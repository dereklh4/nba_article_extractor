The struggles are real for the Cavaliers as they've underperformed against the league's best while LeBron James has the worst plus/minus since his rookie season. (0:44)

Despite his team losing 12 of its last 18 games -- including a dispiriting 120-88 loss to visiting Houston on Saturday night -- Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue's job is safe, league sources told ESPN.

"We are not firing our head coach," one Cavaliers official told ESPN late Saturday night.

LeBron: Cavs should be taken off national TV Another blowout loss on a nationally televised game Saturday night had LeBron James and the Cavaliers questioning the team's effort level and pointing to trust issues within the locker room. Rocket science: Chris Paul is thriving in Houston while Isaiah Thomas struggles in Cleveland Chris Paul and Isaiah Thomas were traded to their respective teams last offseason, and Paul had another strong performance at Thomas' expense. This Cavs chaos is unprecedented, and time is running out LeBron James went from being a leading MVP candidate to struggling through one of the worst months of his career. The Cavs know crisis, but this mess is something different.

The Cavaliers are planning to continue pursuing deals to improve the floundering team between now and Thursday's NBA trade deadline, league sources said.

The Cavaliers, including LeBron James, were listless in the loss to the Rockets on national television Saturday night. Cleveland has had a series of blowout losses to drop to 30-21 -- a half-game ahead of Washington in third place in the Eastern Conference and only 1.5 games ahead of Indiana.

Lue has expressed frustration with the team, describing the Cavaliers to ESPN's Lisa Salters at halftime of Saturday's loss as "soft, weak, no physicality, no toughness, no grit."

Cleveland has lost All-Star forward Kevin Love for two months with a fractured left hand, is failing to defend and is fighting internal disconnects as it tries to restore itself to Eastern Conference championship contention.

Lue was promoted to head coach halfway through the 2015-16 NBA season and led the Cavaliers to an NBA Finals victory over Golden State. The Cavaliers lost in the Finals to the Warriors last season.

Lue is 29-10 (.744) in his two trips to the NBA playoffs as Cavaliers coach.
