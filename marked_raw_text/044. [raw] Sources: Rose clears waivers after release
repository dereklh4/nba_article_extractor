<Derrick Rose/>, the 2011 NBA Most Valuable Player, cleared league waivers Monday and became a free agent, league sources told ESPN.

There's some interest in Rose, but no team has yet to make him a firm offer to sign him for the rest of the season, league sources told ESPN.

Washington has considered the possibility of signing <Rose/> in the wake of <John Wall/>'s extended absence after knee surgery, but the team is looking at other candidates, too, league sources said. One of those could be former NBA guard <Ty Lawson/>, who has been playing in China, sources told ESPN.

<Rose/> was waived on Saturday, in the wake of his trade to the Utah Jazz as a part of the Cleveland Cavaliers' three-team deal, which also involved Sacramento.

<Rose/>, 29, signed a one-year, minimum contract with Cleveland in the summer. He had a choppy tenure this season, including an ankle injury that prompted him to leave the team for several days and contemplate his future in the league.

The No. 1 overall pick in 2008 was a three-time All-Star and an MVP with the Chicago Bulls, but a series of knee injuries derailed his career. He was traded to New York for the 2016-17 season.
