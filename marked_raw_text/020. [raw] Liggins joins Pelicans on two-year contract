Free-agent guard DeAndre Liggins has agreed to a deal to return to the New Orleans Pelicans, the team announced Monday.

Terms were not disclosed, but league sources tell ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski that the deal is for two years.

Liggins' 10-day contract with New Orleans recently expired. He'll sign for the rest of the season and has a partial guarantee for 2018-19.

New Orleans is the seventh NBA team for Liggins in his career, which has included stops with Orlando, Oklahoma City, Miami, Cleveland and Dallas since he was drafted out of Kentucky in 2011.

Liggins was a Kentucky teammate of two Pelicans: center DeMarcus Cousins and guard Darius Miller.
