10:42 a.m. ET: As the Los Angeles Lakers become more realistic about the franchise's chances of snaring superstars in the free-agent class of 2018, the front office is increasingly looking through a longer lens in its team-building process, league sources told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Adrian Wojnarowski. The Lakers aren't abandoning a summer pursuit of stars, but they are recalibrating their focus on a 2019 class that could include San Antonio's Kawhi Leonard, Golden State's Klay Thompson and Minnesota's Jimmy Butler, league sources said.

6:36p.m. ET: The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to trade center Tyler Zeller to the Milwaukee Bucks for guard Rashad Vaughn and a protected 2018 second-round pick, league sources tell ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

6:30 p.m. ET: The LA Clippers have agreed to trade All-Star forward Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons, league sources tell ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

The Clippers are also sending Brice Johnson and Willie Reed to Detroit alongside Griffin, sources say.

9:35 a.m. ET: The Detroit Pistons have made starting shooting guard Avery Bradley available in trade talks, league sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

9:57 a.m. ET: Overloaded with bad contracts and untradeable assets, the Charlotte Hornets have made All-Star point guard Kemba Walker available in trade discussions, league sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

8:30 a.m. ET: League executives and agents judging the market believe that Isaiah Thomas, who is in a contract year and is expected to seek a max deal this summer, has the best chance at a significant contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers, but the Brooklyn Nets, Phoenix Suns and Indiana Pacers are other possibilities, according to a report from ESPN's Brian Windhorst. Cleveland has Thomas' full Bird rights.

5:33 p.m. ET: So far, serious offers for LA Clippers center DeAndre Jordan, who can decline the player option on his $24.1 million contract for 2018-19, have been slow to come, according to a report by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. "He's a difference-maker, but I'm not sure anyone thinks he puts you over the top," one GM said.

5:01 p.m. ET: According to a report by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Detroit Pistons pursued Orlando Magic forward Evan Fournier, but any potential deal would have been hard to execute without including the contract of guard Reggie Jackson, who will be out until February with a sprained ankle.
