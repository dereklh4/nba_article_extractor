Utah Jazz rookie <Donovan Mitchell/> will participate in the dunk contest during NBA All-Star Weekend, replacing injured Orlando Magic forward <Aaron Gordon/>.

<Mitchell/> told reporters on Monday that he received the news on Sunday night.

"When I found out, I was excited," <Mitchell/> told reporters. "I have a couple of ideas. I've been googling YouTube and watching old dunk contests. I'm definitely excited to participate."

<Mitchell/>, 21, has exploded into the NBA as a rookie this season, shoulder to shoulder with Philadelphia's <Ben Simmons/> in the Rookie of the Year race. He's shown a penchant for explosive dunks and could fare well in the event.

<Mitchell/> is averaging 19.7 points, 3.5 assists and 3.4 rebounds per game for Utah. He's had two 40-plus-point performances.

<Gordon/>, who leads the Magic with 18.4 points per game average this season, has missed the team's past three games with his injury.

<Gordon/> had competed in the past two All-Star dunk contests and finished as runner-up in 2016. He was eliminated in the first round last year.

<Mitchell/> joins Indiana Pacers guard <Victor Oladipo/>, Los Angeles Lakers center <Larry Nance Jr/>. and Dallas Mavericks rookie guard <Dennis Smith Jr/>. in the dunk contest.
