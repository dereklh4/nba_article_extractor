<Terry Rozier/> fills in admirably for <Kyrie Irving/>, recording a triple-double, and the Knicks only score 8 points in the fourth quarter of Boston's 103-73 win. (1:20)

All-Star point guard <Kyrie Irving/> will miss his second straight game because of a right quadriceps contusion, and the Boston Celtics could be limited to as few as 10 available players during Friday's visit by the Atlanta Hawks.

<Irving/> bruised his quad during the Celtics' win in Denver on Monday. He was listed as probable for Wednesday's game against the Knicks, but coach <Brad Stevens/> said <Irving/> was stiff that day and the team will give him additional time to heal. This is the first time that Irving has missed consecutive games this season.

"<Kyrie/> feels a little bit better, again, but still will be day-to-day," <Stevens/> said. "<[Irving/> is] not ready to play."

<Stevens/> said <Irving/> could potentially suit up Sunday, but the team will wait to see how he feels closer to the game.

<Greg Monroe/> has agreed to a one-year, $5 million contract with the Boston Celtics, league sources told ESPN.

The Celtics ruled out <Irving/>, <Marcus Morris/> (hip), <Marcus Smart/> (hand) and <Shane Larkin/> (knee) from Friday's game. <Terry Rozier/>, who had a triple-double in his first career start Wednesday against the New York Knicks, seems likely to start again in place of <Irving/>.

Asked if <Rozier/> would indeed be back in the starting five, <Stevens/> said: "I think that would be a good idea. Yeah, we'll do that. He might be in every five. He might be all 48 minutes and every five."

"<Marcus Morris/>, I joked that his butt's better, but we're not playing him because he wore that [Philadelphia Eagles] jersey the other day when he was being interviewed," <Stevens/> cracked.

<Morris/> wore an <Alshon Jeffery/> jersey to his postgame media session Wednesday. The Patriots and Eagles meet in Super Bowl LII on Sunday.

"<[Morris]/> feels better than we thought he would, but he's still going to be out at least for the foreseeable future, a couple of days. And we'll go from there."

<Morris/> landed hard on his backside Wednesday after getting clipped by New York's <Michael Beasley/> on a breakaway dunk. <Smart/> is out for two weeks after punching a picture frame at Boston's team hotel in Los Angeles last week. <Larkin/> will miss his third straight game while battling knee soreness.

<Stevens/> suggested there's a chance <Smart/> won't play again until after the All-Star break while waiting for the skin on the back of his hand to heal.

The Celtics are already without <Gordon Hayward/> (ankle) and cannot officially sign free-agent big man <Greg Monroe/> until he clears waivers Saturday.

Barring an emergency call-up of another G League two-way player, Boston will have only 10 available players for Friday's game. Six of those players are rookies.
