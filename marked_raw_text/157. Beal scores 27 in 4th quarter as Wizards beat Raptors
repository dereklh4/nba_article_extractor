<Bradley Beal/> shows off his handles on a sweet move to the basket for a lay-in. (0:18)

WASHINGTON -- Washington's <Bradley Beal/> says he's playing with less stress since making his first NBA All-Star Game.

The way he shook off his miserable start on Thursday, he might be onto something.

<Beal/> scored 25 of his 27 points in the second half, helping the Wizards to a 122-119 victory over the Toronto Raptors.

"It lifted a little bit of a burden off my shoulders," said <Beal/>, who overcame the first half of his NBA career without a made field goal. "That's something I don't have to think about or try to prove. I can just play freely, enjoy the process, enjoy the moment."

The Wizards had eight players score in double figures in their third straight win without All-Star point guard <John Wall/>, who had surgery on his left knee on Wednesday.

<Otto Porter Jr./> had 16 points and 11 rebounds in his first double-double since early December, and <Markieff Morris/> scored 15 points -- including five straight in a stretch that gave Washington the lead for good in a dogged battle against the second-place team in the Eastern Conference.

"It's basically a simulation of the playoffs," <Morris/> said. "Bodies flying everywhere and you just got to play through it. The toughest team is going to win like it did tonight."

<Kyle Lowry/> scored 17 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter for Toronto, but missed two late free throws. All-Star <DeMar DeRozan/> added 23 points and Serge Ibaka had 16 after a potential tying 3-pointer rimmed out late.

"I'll live with Serge's shot any day," <DeRozan/> said. "I'll live with <Kyle/> going to the free-throw line any day. It just didn't go in."

<Morris/> capped a 9-0 run by hitting a pair of free throws and then a baseline 3-pointer off <Porter/>'s feed to put Washington up 115-110. From there, the Wizards hit seven of their last eight foul shots to seal the game.

<Lowry/> hit a spinning runner to cut it to 118-116 with 11.6 seconds left, but couldn't convert the three-point play. Then with 3 seconds left and Toronto down 120-118, <Lowry/> reached a loose ball off Washington's inbounds and got fouled, but missed the first of two foul shots.

"I wasn't clutch enough," <Lowry/> said. "But trust me, I will be next time."

Raptors: F/G <C.J. Miles/> (sore right knee) missed his second straight game. ... G <Fred VanFleet/> did not play due to personal reasons. ... C <Jonas Valanciunas/> is 5 for 6 from 3-point range over his last four games. He went 2 for 2 twice in the first two games with multiple 3s in his career.

Wizards: G <Jodie Meeks/> scored each of his 10 points in the fourth quarter, posting double digits for the first time since Dec. 29. ... <Tomas Satoransky/> started his third straight game at point guard in Wall's absence, a stretch that equaled his previous career starts total. ... Coach <Scott Brooks/> received a technical foul moments after the halftime buzzer.

Former Washington and Toronto G <Rasual Butler/> was honored with a pregame moment of silence. <Butler/> and his wife died in a single-automobile accident in Los Angeles on Wednesday morning. He was 38.

<DeRozan/> was named the NBA's Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January after averaging 25.3 points and 5.9 assists.

<DeRozan/>'s full-court inbounds pass to end the game was intercepted. But he completed a similar heave that nearly led to points at the first-quarter buzzer, and said afterward it's a skill he's always had.

"I've been a black Tom Brady for a while now," <DeRozan/> deadpanned.

Wizards: Play six of their next seven on the road, beginning in Orlando on Saturday.
