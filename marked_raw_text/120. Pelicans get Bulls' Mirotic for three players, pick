<Adrian Wojnarowski/> reports that the Pelicans will acquire <Nikola Mirotic/> from the Bulls. (0:55)

The New Orleans Pelicans acquired Chicago Bulls forward <Nikola Mirotic/> on Thursday.

The Pelicans were able to complete the deal once they decided to guarantee the $12.5 million team option on <Mirotic/>'s contract next season, which allowed the Bulls to complete the trade without Mirotic's permission, league sources said.

The Pelicans sent a 2018 protected first-round pick, center <Omer Asik/> and guards <Tony Allen/> and <Jameer Nelson/> to the Bulls.

How much will Nikola Mirotic help the Pelicans' playoff push? Did the Bulls get enough in the deal? <Kevin Pelton/> grades the trade. <Nikola Mirotic/> reflects on up-and-down year as he leaves Chicago With a summer without a contract, a training camp altercation and career highs across the board, 2017-18 has been a strange season for <Nikola Mirotic/>, who will now pick things up in New Orleans. Who benefits most from the <Nikola Mirotic/> trade? The Chicago Bulls traded <Nikola Mirotic/> to the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday. Which players will be impacted most in fantasy?

The Pelicans had to attach a first-round pick to unload the salary of <Asik/>, who is owed $10.5 million this season, $11.2 million in 2018-19 and $3 million in guaranteed money in 2019-20. The Pelicans' first-round pick on its way to the Bulls is a protected top-5 selection in 2018; top-8 in 2019; top-10 in 2020; and, top-9 in 2021, league sources said.

If the first-round pick hasn't conveyed to the Bulls in 2021, it becomes a second-round pick in 2022 and 2023, sources said.

The Pelicans were able to create a roster spot to sign center <Greg Monroe/>, whom they're courting aggressively after his contract buyout with the Phoenix Suns.

Bulls executive VP <John Paxson/> said he was pleased with what the Bulls received in return for <Mirotic/> and was confident this was the best deal that presented itself.

"<Niko/>'s representatives were consistent over the last several months that they wanted him moved," <Paxson/> said during a Thursday conference call. "And they never backed off that stance one bit. I'm sure that given everything that we'd heard from them through this entire process that he just wanted to be elsewhere. This satisfies what he wanted. More than that, it satisfies what we wanted to get out of it in moving him. Again, it fits our timeline, it fits the direction we're going."

The Bulls will waive <Allen/> but plan to keep <Nelson/>, league sources said.

The Bulls will also send a 2018 second-round pick -- acquired via New Orleans in a trade for <Quincy Pondexter/> -- and will have the right to swap second-round picks with the Pelicans in the 2021 draft, league sources said.

The Bulls waived <Pondexter/> to create the roster space to complete the trade.

<Mirotic/> signed a two-year deal with the Bulls in August. He has thrived with the Bulls, averaging 16.8 points and 6.4 rebounds since missing the first 23 games of the season after a scuffle in practice with <Bobby Portis/> left <Mirotic/> with facial fractures and a concussion.
