MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Timberwolves have recalled center Justin Patton from their NBA G League affiliate, the Iowa Wolves.

The move was made on Monday. Patton has averaged 11.9 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.4 blocks and 20.1 minutes over 25 games for Iowa, after being assigned there on Dec. 27.

The 16th overall pick in the draft last year out of Creighton, Patton has yet to appear in an NBA game. The Timberwolves and the Washington Wizards are the only teams in the league this season that have yet to play a rookie.

The 6-foot-11 Patton broke his left foot during a workout last summer and needed surgery to repair the fifth metatarsal bone.
