The game of the night on Wednesday was an absolute classic, with LeBron James blocking a shot and hitting a jumper in the last few seconds of overtime to lead the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 140-138 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. With all of the buzz surrounding the Cavaliers these days due to their recent run of poor play and all of the rumors surrounding Thursday's potential trade deadline deals, this game was monstrous.

Does the Knicks-Hornets trade free Willy Hernangomez in fantasy? He went from being a potential breakout fantasy player to a benchwarmer in New York this season. Will he turn things around with the Hornets? We take a trip around the NBA to suss out key fantasy tidbits on every team, including the latest on players rumored to be on the trade block and those who are dealing with injuries.

Perhaps I have a bit of a unique take here, but I believe this "instant classic" was somewhat predictable, and contains elements that, in the future, you should be looking for when searching for streaming and/or DFS options.

In the "Analytics advantage" section of yesterday's Daily Notes, I pointed out that you should have been targeting this game because of a relatively unique set of circumstances. Both teams ranked in the top five in the NBA in offensive efficiency -- Minnesota was third (113.5 points per 100 possessions) and Cleveland was fifth (111.1). Both teams were also ranked in the bottom six in the NBA in defensive efficiency. Minnesota was 25th (110.0 points allowed) and Cleveland was 29th (111.8).

While there's a lot of game-to-game variability in expected value, the recipe was absolutely in place for some great fantasy lines to be produced - and, indeed there were. Take a look:

Of those 10 lines, four came from players available in more than 80 percent of leagues: Smith at 95 percent, Thompson at 83.8 percent, Korver at 94.3 percent and Crawford at 96 percent. Eight of the players -- everyone but Wiggins and Thomas -- outperformed their DFS expectations. This was a game that you wanted to be a big part of for fantasy purposes.

There are two other teams currently ranked in the top 10 in offensive rating and the bottom 10 in defensive rating: the New Orleans Pelicans (109.6 points scored, 110.0 points allowed) and the Denver Nuggets (110.3 points scored, 109.3 points allowed). Of course, teams may move on and off of this list but, moving forward, any game featuring two teams from this "club" should be circled on the calendar as a potential fantasy feast. Denver-Cleveland on March 3, anyone?

The Atlanta Hawks have allowed their opponents to dish 25.6 assists per game (29th in the NBA), make 11.3 3-pointers per game (27th in NBA) and at a 27.6 3-Pt% (29th in NBA). They also allow 8.6 steals per game (27th in NBA). This, then, sets up as a day that their opponents, the Orlando Magic, should see strong numbers among their perimeter players. Elfrid Payton, Evan Fournier, Jonathon Simmons (73.8 percent availability) and Mario Hezonja (89.4 percent availability) could all be better options than usual on Thursday.
