DALLAS -- Dallas Mavericks guard <Seth Curry/> has undergone season-ending surgery for a stress fracture in his lower left leg and is expected to resume full activities within three months.

<Curry/>, the younger brother of Golden State star <Stephen Curry/>, hasn't played this season because of the injury. The 27-year-old will be an unrestricted free agent this summer. <Curry/> had the procedure Thursday.

The former Duke standout had his best season as a pro with the Mavericks in 2016-17, averaging 12.8 points and 2.7 assists. <Curry/> was expected to start alongside rookie point guard <Dennis Smith Jr/>., the No. 9 pick in the draft.

Dallas is expected to have an interest in re-signing <Curry/>, an undrafted player who got into just two games in each of his first two seasons. He played 44 games for Sacramento the season before the Mavericks signed him.
