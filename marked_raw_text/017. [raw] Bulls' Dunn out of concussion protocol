CHICAGO -- Bulls point guard Kris Dunn is out of the NBA's concussion protocol, though he will miss at least two more games for Chicago.

Executive vice president of basketball operations John Paxson says Dunn "still has a long way to go conditioning-wise," though he is "feeling normal."

The second-year pro has missed the past eight games and will not play against Minnesota or Washington on Friday and Saturday. Chicago meets Orlando on Monday.

Dunn, averaging 13.7 points and 6.4 assists, was acquired along with Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen from Minnesota in the trade that sent Jimmy Butler to the Timberwolves on draft night.
