Marco Belinelli has committed to signing with the Philadelphia 76ers, league sources told ESPN.

The Sixers were one of several playoff teams and contenders to offer Belinelli, a savvy veteran shooting guard, a roster spot for the balance of the season.

As they push to make the playoffs for the first time in five years, the Sixers recruited Belinelli with the promise of a significant role off the bench.

Belinelli signaled his impending arrival in Philadelphia in a tweet Saturday night.

Belinelli, 31, will clear waivers and become an unrestricted free agent by Monday. After failing to find a trade it was willing to make, the Atlanta Hawks reached a buyout agreement on Belinelli's expiring $6.3 million contract.

Free agents need to be bought out of contracts before March 1 to be eligible for playoff rosters.

Belinelli averaged 11.4 points for the Hawks this season. In a decade in the NBA, he has averaged 9.8 points a game.
