INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indiana Pacers will be without Darren Collison for two to three weeks after he underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee.

Coach Nate McMillan made the announcement before the start of Monday night's game against Washington.

McMillan said Collison suffered the injury during Saturday's victory over Philadelphia. A subsequent MRI showed he needed surgery, and McMillan says the Pacers hope to get Collison back shortly after the All-Star break.

Collison is averaging 12.8 points, 5.3 assists and 1.4 steals while shooting 43.2 percent on 3-pointers. Cory Joseph will replace Collison in the lineup.

An illness also will keep All-Star guard Victor Oladipo out of Monday's game. He will be replaced by Lance Stephenson.
