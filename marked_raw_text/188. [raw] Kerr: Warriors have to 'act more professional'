<Steve Kerr/> expresses his desire for his team to start composing themselves, but <Draymond Green/> found himself T'd up for the 14th time this season against the Mavericks. (0:49)

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Golden State forward <Draymond Green/> was fined $50,000 by the NBA on Thursday for directing inappropriate and offensive language toward a game official two days earlier, and he was hardly the only member of the Warriors to lose his cool.

<Green/> was ejected with 8:13 left in the game after a second technical for arguing with the officials, specifically female referee <Lauren Holtkamp/>. The NBA said the specific incident for which he was penalized came in the second quarter of the Warriors' 125-105 home loss to Oklahoma City on Tuesday night.

Trade deadline winners and losers: Lakers, Warriors, <Isaiah/> and more The Cavs' moves might help, but did they do enough to challenge the Warriors? <Kevin Pelton/> highlights seven winners and losers at the trade deadline.

The defending champion Warriors had five technicals in all, prompting general manager <Bob Myers/> to address the topic with the team Thursday ahead of a home game against Dallas.

"With great expectations comes great scrutiny. So how do we live in that? What's the best way to be in that?'' <Myers/> said. "So, empathetic toward the role and the place they have in all this as players as the most visible parts of our organization, the most important parts. Just kind of bringing that out and reminding them.''

<Green/> had two technicals Tuesday, coach <Steve Kerr/> one, and <Andre Iguodala/> and <David West/> had one each.

On Thursday night, <Green/> got hit with his 14th technical of the season -- two away from an automatic suspension -- for arguing after a delay of game warning in the second quarter of the Warriors' 121-103 win over the Dallas Mavericks.

Regarding <Myers/>' words, <Kerr/> said, "It's not a good look. We need to look more professional, to act more professional and to be more poised and to represent our team in a better light. I don't think we've been doing a good job of that lately."

<Green/>, the reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year, received dental work Wednesday after being hit in the mouth and bloodied in a collision with <Jerami Grant/>. <Green/> said he would wear clear braces for a couple of weeks.

<Green/> said dentists will monitor his tooth.

"It hasn't died. Hopefully it stays alive," he said.

Last month, <Green/> was fined $25,000 for criticizing the NBA's officiating. He's averaging 11.1 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.3 assists in 47 games this season.

Golden State leads the NBA with nine ejections and 35 player technical fouls.

Counting coach and team technicals, the Warriors rank third in the NBA with 47, including five for <Kerr/>.

"I am as guilty as anybody," <Kerr/> said. "I think we all need to do a much better job of staying poised. I don't like the look of the constant complaining, myself included. I think we've got to get better. I didn't know anything about the <Draymond/> incident. ... Just in general on the technicals, on the behavior, we've got to get more poised and take care of our own business and focus on our play and not anything else."

<Myers/> said he doesn't want his coach or the fiery <Green/> to change.

"It's hard because we want competitive people,'' <Myers/> said. "One of my favorite things about <Steve Kerr/> and <Draymond/> is it's a deep, deep competitiveness and so that's fantastic. That's what we want, but at the same time, how do you channel that appropriately? How do I do it? How do they do it? How do any of us that have that inside of us live in that, in great competition, with great emotion? I do understand when it boils over. They're human beings, too.''
