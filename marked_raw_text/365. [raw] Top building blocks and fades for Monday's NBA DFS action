Which players should you build around and which players should you fade in DFS as we tip off tonight's NBA action? Our experts have the answers.

Thursday's flurry of Cavaliers trades paid off Sunday, as they smoked the Celtics. Here's a look at the fantasy buzz from all of yesterday's action and a look ahead to Monday's slate.

Drummond is very simply the most dominant interior presence in the NBA right now. He has averaged 18.4 points, 19.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.7 blocks and 2.3 steals in seven games since the trade that brought Blake Griffin to town and on Monday he has what should be a fun matchup against Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans. Additionally, since Davis has moved to center in place of DeMarcus Cousins, the Pelicans have been more vulnerable to opposing centers, allowing the eighth-most fantasy points to the position over their last five games.

When I'm searching for a player to build around, I want him to check at least three of these four boxes: minutes, matchup, value, and skill. The last one is obviously subjective, but I truly believe Holiday marks off all four of these boxes tonight and I'm locking him in across the board. There is no denying that he will be on the floor (34.2 minutes per game with at least 36 minutes in all four games this month) and given that the Magic rank as a bottom five defense against opposing shooting guards this season, I can't figure out why his price is so low. I'm willing to buy into the confidence he is playing with (multiple 3s made in six straight games and only two total turnovers in his past three games) in an offense that is projected to score 105 points tonight. All Holiday has to do is reach his season averages to flirt with value in this spot, and I think there is room for much more.

Griffin has seamlessly transitioned to his new team, providing strong multi-category production in each of his games so far. He, and to a somewhat lesser extent, teammate Andre Drummond, will enjoy the league's best frontcourt matchup for fantasy on this slate. Thinking about how to allocate salary tonight, I'm less inclined to pay up for the expensive Warriors than I am for Griffin. This game should remain competitive and high scoring, with the Pistons getting to take advantage of the New Orleans pace bump while Golden State could be done after three quarters or less. Griffin offers a high floor and a high ceiling for a reasonable salary that fits any and all lineups tonight.

This one is counter-intuitive, given that the Phoenix Suns are awful on defense and play at a fast pace. However, the Warriors are so much better than the Suns that this game has mega blowout potential, especially if Devin Booker sits again. Further, Curry has played fewer than 30 minutes in three of the last six games, a stretch during which he has averaged "only" 19.8 points, 6.0 assists, 4.8 rebounds, 1.2 steals and 3.0 3-pointers in 32.2 minutes. These are solid numbers, but far short of what Curry is capable of or what you would need given his max price tag. It appears that the Warriors are coasting into the All-Star Break, and if the pattern holds Curry would be in for another solid yet underwhelming game before sitting out the fourth quarter.

No one is going to dispute his talent, but I'm not interested in him as the only tier one price option on this six game slate. When you build around The Brow, you're operating under the thought that the opponent does not have a big that can handle him on the perimeter and that Davis can dominate the glass. Well, the athletic Blake Griffin is as mobile as any front court player in the league and he's averaged 34 minutes per game since joining the Pistons. When it comes to rebounding, not only is Griffin plenty capable, but Andre Drummond engulfs most misses and ranks second in overall rebound rate this season. I also worry about the schedule taking its toll on Davis, as he is averaging over 38 minutes per game since we flipped the calendar to 2018 and played 50 minutes in a double overtime win over the Nets on Saturday. I don't think he sinks your ship tonight, but on this slate I'd rather spend up for Joel Embiid or pinch pennies with Bobby Portis in my frontcourt.

Warren is a tricky play tonight, because he's been very solid against average teams, but has really struggled lately against very good defensive teams like Utah and San Antonio. Golden State ranks sixth in overall defensive efficiency, and allows the third-fewest fantasy points to opposing small forwards. Phoenix may be without Devin Booker again tonight, but I'm not sure Warren can do enough to warrant his rising salary. Given the many options at his position tonight, I'm downgrading Warren significantly.
