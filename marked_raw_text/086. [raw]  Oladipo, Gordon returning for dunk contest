Los Angeles Lakers forward <Larry Nance Jr/>., whose father won the inaugural Slam Dunk competition in 1984, joins the field for this year's dunk contest, along with Indiana Pacers guard <Victor Oladipo/>, Orlando Magic forward <Aaron Gordon/> and Dallas Mavericks rookie <Dennis Smith Jr/>.

We've got all you need to know about the NBA's All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles (Feb. 16-18).

The competition, part of the NBA's All-Star Weekend, is Feb. 17 at Staples Center in Los Angeles.

<Oladipo/> is competing in his second Slam Dunk competition, having finished second to Bulls guard <Zach LaVine/> in 2015. Last season, <Oladipo/> won the Dunk of the Year in voting by fans for the inaugural NBA Awards.

<Gordon/> is making his third appearance. He was runner-up to <LaVine/> in 2016 and put on a show, garnering three perfect scores during the competition.

<Nance/> is attempting to become the Lakers' first Slam Dunk winner since <Kobe Bryant/> in 1997, and he'll be doing it on his home court.

<Nance/>'s father, All-Star <Larry Nance/>, beat Philadelphia 76ers legend <Julius Erving/> in the final round of the 1984 contest, besting <Dr. J/> by cradling the ball for a one-handed dunk to clinch the championship. He said he entered the contest because there was a $10,000 prize and he wanted to buy a Camaro.

The dunk competition is a two-round event, and players have a maximum of three attempts to complete each dunk. Five judges score the dunks on a scale of 6 to 10.

Houston Rockets guard <Eric Gordon/> will return to defend his title in the All-Star Weekend's 3-point contest.

<Gordon/> will face a field of some of the best shooters in the game: Oklahoma City Thunder forward <Paul George/>, Golden State Warriors guard <Klay Thompson/>, Toronto Raptors guard <Kyle Lowry/>, Phoenix Suns guard <Devin Booker/>, Miami Heat guard <Wayne Ellington/>, Washington Wizards guard <Bradley Beal/> and LA Clippers forward <Tobias Harris/>.
