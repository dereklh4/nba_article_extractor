Knicks center <Willy Hernangomez/> says while he likes playing with <Kristaps Porzingis/>, he'd like to be somewhere he can continue to develop. (1:04)

With the NBA trade deadline three days away, New York Knicks center <Willy Hernangomez/> is looking for a bigger role -- whether it's in New York or with another team, league sources familiar with the matter said.

For several weeks, <Hernangomez/>'s representatives have expressed frustration to the Knicks over <Hernangomez/>'s reduced role and his lack of development this season, sources said.

More recently, they've told the Knicks that they want them to explore a trade that puts Hernangomez in a situation where he can play more and continue to develop, league sources confirmed. More than a dozen teams have expressed interest in <Hernangomez/> and several have made specific offers to the Knicks, according to league sources.

After earning All-Rookie honors last season, <Hernangomez/> has fallen out of New York's rotation in 2017-18. He has appeared in just 25 of the team's 54 games, averaging 4.4 points and 2.6 rebounds in 9.2 minutes per game. <Enes Kanter/>, whom the Knicks acquired in September in the <Carmelo Anthony/> trade, has started at center. <Kyle O'Quinn/>, who has also drawn interest from opposing teams, has filled in at backup center.

New York would need to move <Kanter/> or <O'Quinn/> if it wanted to create an increased role for <Hernangomez/>, whose desire for a trade was first reported by Yahoo! Sports.

The Knicks are not inclined to give <Hernangomez/> away for a minimal return. <Hernangomez/>, 23, is in the second year of a four-year contract that is worth $3.2 million in total over the next two seasons. New York is looking for a significant return in any trade involving <Hernangomez/>, whether it's in the form of draft picks or a talented young player, according to opposing executives. <Hernangomez/>, who is close friends with <Kristaps Porzingis/>, averaged 8.2 points and 7.0 rebounds in 18 minutes per game last season.

The club is hopeful that it can reintegrate <Hernangomez/> if it is unable to trade him by Thursday, opposing executives say. The Knicks still see <Hernangomez/> as a potential part of their young core, which includes, <Porzingis/>, <Tim Hardaway Jr./> and rookie point guard <Frank Ntilikina/>.

The 6-foot-11 center said last month that he wants to remain in New York but also has to do what's best for his career.

New York (23-31) has lost 10 of 14 and enters play Monday four games out of eighth place in the Eastern Conference.

In addition to dealing with <Hernangomez/>'s situation, the Knicks also hope to trade exiled center <Joakim Noah/> before Thursday's trade deadline, according to ESPN's <Adrian Wojnarowski/>. Finding a deal for <Noah/> and the three years, $54 million left on his contract has already been a futile task for the Knicks, who, league sources told <Wojnarowski/>, are unwilling to attach significant future draft assets or young Knicks players to incentivize a team to take on <Noah/>.

<Noah/> and the Knicks mutually agreed last week that the veteran center will not return to the club until further notice.

<Noah/> has been exiled from the Knicks since Jan. 25 after a dispute with coach <Jeff Hornacek/>.
