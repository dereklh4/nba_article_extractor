SALT LAKE CITY -- The season hit a low point for Utah nearly three weeks ago in a 14-point loss to an Atlanta team that's currently tied for the fewest wins in the league.

<Donovan Mitchell/> scored 25 points and previewed his Slam Dunk Contest appearance with two tomahawk jams, and the Jazz extended their league-best winning streak to eight with a 106-94 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night.

The streak is Utah's longest since winning nine in a row in 2010.

"There's always some games in the NBA season where you lay an egg and it has more to do with how you respond," Jazz coach <Quin Snyder/> said. "Our guys have gained some confidence in general. The determination came before the confidence. They have pride, collective pride. That game didn't feel good."

<Joe Ingles/> scored a career-high 23 points with six assists and five rebounds for the Jazz. <Rudy Gobert/> added 20 points and 11 rebounds.

"(The streak) means a lot," Jazz forward <Derrick Favors/> said. "We're definitely in the playoff hunt. Guys are playing better, the team as a whole is playing better. We're focused. Dialed in every night. Defensively, we've been great. Offensively, things are clicking for us. We've just got to keep it up."

<Kemba Walker/> scored 19 points for the Hornets, who lost three straight to conclude their four-game Western Conference trip.

"Balanced play," Hornets coach <Steve Clifford/> said of the Jazz. "<Gobert/> makes them a different team at both ends of the floor. It's not just his defense. He's a good roller. He puts a lot of pressure on your defense. He's a good pick-and-roll player and they're playing at a really high level now."

The Jazz withstood a 3-point barrage from the Hornets in the third quarter and closed the period with a 9-2 stretch jump-started by a cutting dunk from <Jonas Jerebko/>. Utah extended the run to 16-5 early in the fourth for a 91-79 lead that was too much for Charlotte to rally from.

The Jazz held the Hornets to 17 points in the final quarter and outscored Charlotte 58-30 in the paint.

"I guess we just lost our juice a little bit and they kind of took advantage of that," <Walker/> said.

Hornets: <Willy Hernangomez/>, acquired Thursday in a trade with the Trail Blazers, was inactive. ... <Dwight Howard/> fouled out with five points and nine rebounds.

Jazz: <Jae Crowder/>, acquired in a trade with the Cavaliers, was not yet available to play. He sat behind the bench in street clothes. ... <Ricky Rubio/> left in the third quarter with left hip soreness and did not return.

The Jazz played their first game without <Rodney Hood/> and <Joe Johnson/>, who were traded away Thursday. <Hood/> was second on the team with 16.8 points per game. He and <Johnson/> missed a combined 37 games this season, so the Jazz were already accustomed to their absence.

"You're going to have to adapt throughout the course of the season. Whatever it is," <Snyder/> said. "You may have more injuries than the other team. You may have less. You may have a roster situation, a trade. (It all) requires adaptation.

"As long as you're adapting to what you have and are focused on that, the external stuff (doesn't matter as much). ... They've done a good job staying focused through whatever's happened."

Hornets: Host <DeMar DeRozan/> and the Toronto Raptors on Sunday.

Jazz: Travel to face <Damian Lillard/> and the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday.
