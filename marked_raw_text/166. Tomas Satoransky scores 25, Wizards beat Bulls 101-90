CHICAGO -- <Tomas Satoransky/> is starting while star guard <John Wall/> recovers from knee surgery. He stepped up Saturday for struggling All-Star <Bradley Beal/> as well.

<Satoransky/> scored a career-high 25 points on 10-of-12 shooting and the Washington Wizards beat the Chicago Bulls 101-90.

"It's not often that you can win a game on the road and our All-Star guard didn't have a good game -- 0 for 7 from 3," Washington coach <Scott Brooks/> said. "<Tomas/> was on fire, played a great game, made a lot of plays for us.

"He's really developing. He's tough, he's competitive and he makes good plays for us."

<Satoransky/>'s career night, though, was cut short. He fell hard to the court and hit his head after being fouled with 2 1/2 minutes left in the game. He was taken to the locker room bleeding from the right temple.

The 26-year-old from the Czech Republic didn't speak with reporters afterward, but was in the locker room -- with a bandage over his right eyebrow -- talking and joking with teammates. <Brooks/> said <Satoransky/> is "going to be all right," but it's unclear whether he'll enter the NBA's concussion protocol.

<Otto Porter Jr/>. and <Mike Scott/> had 15 points apiece as the Wizards won for the sixth time in seven games. Beal had seven points on 3-for-13 shooting.

<Justin Holiday/> had 15 points and <Bobby Portis/> added 13 for Chicago, which has dropped eight of nine.

<Satoransky/> had 15 in the first half to pace Washington to a 56-46 halftime edge. The lead was 82-70 entering the fourth quarter.

<Jason Smith/> hit a jumper with just under 8 minutes to go to give the Wizards a 95-79 lead, their biggest of the game.

The Bulls rallied and pulled to 97-90 following back-to-back 3-pointers by <Jerian Grant/> and <Holiday/> with 4:14 left. They had a chance to move closer a short while later, but <Lauri Markkanen/> missed an open 3.

<Satoransky/> then stopped the Chicago run at the other end with a 3-pointer -- his fifth on six attempts -- to make it 100-90 with 3:24 remaining.

<Satoransky/> looked to put the finishing touch on a career night on Washington's next possession. He drove to the basket for a layup attempt but was fouled hard by <Portis/>. <Satoransky/> landed on his right shoulder and then hit the right side of his head on the floor.

"Everybody knows the rule," <Brooks/> said. "It's a dangerous play. If (<Portis/>) had to do it all over again, he probably would have taken it back."

<Portis/> said he was surprised with the call.

"It was a basketball play to help my team try to stay in the game," he said. "That's what that was. No injury was intended on <Satoransky/>. Just competing hard like I always do."

Wizards: G <Tim Frazier/> suffered a nasal fracture in the first half and did not return . F <Markieff Morris/> sat out with flu-like symptoms. <Kelly Oubre/> started in his place. ... With <Wall/> (knee surgery) likely out for another month, media reports have linked Washington to G <Derrick Rose/>, who was waived by Utah. "We made a trade to have that flexibility," <Brooks/> said. "If something presents itself that makes sense -- for us and the player -- we will obviously look into it."

Bulls: G <Denzel Valentine/> started in <LaVine/>'s spot and finished with 10 points (4 for 14 shooting) and 10 rebounds.

The Bulls were playing without guard <Zach LaVine/>, who hasn't been cleared to play in back-to-back games following ACL surgery last February. <LaVine/> scored 35 points -- including his team's last 11 -- in Chicago's 114-113 win over Minnesota on Friday.

<LaVine/> played 33 minutes on Friday and could be cleared to play back-to-back games soon. "We'll re-evaluate when we get through the All-Star break," coach <Fred Hoiberg/> said.
