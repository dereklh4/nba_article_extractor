<DeAndre Jordan/> dunks it down eight times in his 30-point, 13-rebound performance as LA wins in Boston 129-119. (1:19)

BOSTON -- Guarding <DeAndre Jordan/> in the paint is hard enough.

When he's making his free throws, that makes it a much bigger problem.

<Jordan/> had a career-high 30 points and 13 rebounds and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Boston Celtics 129-119 on Wednesday night for their fourth victory in five games.

The 6-foot-11 center, a 59 percent shooter from the free-throw line coming into the game, went 8 for 9, including hitting all four when Boston coach <Brad Stevens/> called for his team to foul him twice intentionally.

"Made his free throws," Clippers coach <Doc Rivers/> said. "We were jokingly saying: `When we find the hot hand, keep going to it."

<Jordan/> seemed to feed off Boston's poor pick-and-roll defense every time the Clippers needed a basket.

"Whenever I'm setting picks and rolling, it puts a lot of pressure on the defense," he said.

<Jordan/> was 11 of 14 from the field. He entered hitting 64.7 percent of his shots this season.

<Kyrie Irving/> led Boston with 33 points and eight assists. <Al Horford/> had 20 points, and <Marcus Morris/> added 13 points and 11 rebounds. The Celtics lost for the fourth time in five games, a stretch that has seen them fall behind Toronto for the best record in the Eastern Conference.

The Celtics gave up over 120 points for the second straight game, allowing a season-high to the Clippers after giving up 121 against Cleveland on Sunday.

Boston hadn't given up 120 before the last two games.

"We couldn't guard them all night," <Stevens/> said. "So that had nothing to do with the start, middle or finish."

The Celtics are 6-9 in their last 15 games.

"I think the theme here is our defense needs to be better," <Horford/> said. "We're a group that's built what we have so far based on the defensive end. We've taken a big step back on that, it's obvious, the last few games."

Boston had opened a 99-95 lead early in the final quarter on <Terry Rozier/>'s 3 from the left wing before the Clippers went on 10-0 run over a 1:57 stretch.

<Williams/> sparked the spree by scoring the initial six points, with the first 3 coming on a shot from beyond the arc in front of the Celtics' bench. He added a conventional 3-point play after his driving basket.

Los Angeles saw its lead sliced to three twice before <Jordan/> had an alley-oop dunk and <Harris/> followed with a 3-point play with just under three minutes to play.

<Williams/>' 3-point play made it 126-116 in the final two minutes.

In the third quarter, the lead changed hands 10 times in the final 3:11, with the Clippers taking the final one, 93-91, on Harris' 3 from the left wing.

Clippers: The are 5-2 since they sent <Blake Griffin/> to Detroit in blockbuster trade on Jan. 29. ... Former Celtics G <Avery Bradley/> got a nice ovation during pregame introductions.

Celtics: <Stevens/> said G <Marcus Smart/> (cut, right hand) will start practicing next Wednesday, and that he put the team in a "tough position" with the injury that he suffered when he cut his hand on glass at the team hotel in Los Angeles in late January.

Patriots tight end <Rob Gronkowski/> walked into the arena early into the third quarter, bringing cheers and a loud reaction from the fans sitting behind the basket where <Irving/> was shooting free throws.

He waved to the fans when he walked past the stanchion to his front-row seat. Later, he danced when he was shown on the video board.

<Williams/> scored 15 or more points for the 27th straight game, the league's second longest active streak.

<Jordan/> had eight dunks in the game, four coming in the opening quarter.

The Clippers opened a 31-17 lead late in the opening quarter and led 34-25 after one. They held the lead for the entire first half, holding a 61-57 edge at intermission.

Clippers: At Golden State on Feb. 22. They're 1-2 against the Warriors this season, with all the games decided by double digits.

Celtics: At Detroit on Feb. 23. The teams have split two games.
