LeBron James says a team that trades stars under contract like the Clippers did with Blake Griffin doesn't get labeled "a snake" like a player does when he asks for a trade. (0:32)

LeBron James believes there is a double standard in how people characterize front offices and NBA players when it comes to the business of trades and free agency.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, one day after the LA Clippers traded star forward Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons, James pointed to the harsher "narrative" that players have to deal with when they choose to leave a team, compared with when teams trade away players.

Lowe: This Blake Griffin trade might be a trap for 'super-mediocrity' The Pistons got the best player in the deal, but trading for Blake Griffin is still a risk. Zach Lowe breaks down what the move means and what comes next. Doc denies Clips plan to keep trading: 'Not true' Despite trading All-Star forward Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons on Monday, the LA Clippers are not planning on tearing down the roster and trading away their best players before the Feb. 8 trade deadline, coach Doc Rivers said on Tuesday. Stan Van Gundy knows there is risk in the Pistons dealing for Blake Griffin, but it's a risk the basketball lifer is willing to take as he tries to land a star player for a franchise in need of a boost.

"When a player gets traded, [the front office] was doing what was best for the franchise," James said. "But when a player decides to leave, he's not loyal, he's a snake, he's not committed.

"That's the narrative of how it goes. I know that firsthand."

James is no stranger to the firestorm that comes with leaving a franchise. He was heavily criticized for joining the Miami Heat as a free agent in 2010, then received similar scrutiny when he returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers as a free agent in 2014.

James is expected to become a free agent after this season, again making him the focus of speculation over whether he'll stay or go and what his potential landing spots could be.

James said he was "a little bit in shock" when he learned that Griffin, who re-signed with the Clippers on a five-year, $173 million deal this past summer, had been traded after spending his first seven-plus seasons in Los Angeles.

"But you know the business, as unfortunate as it looks," James said. "You know the business. It is what it is."
