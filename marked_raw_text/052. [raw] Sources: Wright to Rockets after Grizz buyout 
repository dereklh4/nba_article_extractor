<Brandan Wright/> will sign with the Houston Rockets after the coveted big man reached a buyout agreement with the Memphis Grizzlies, league sources tell ESPN.

Grizzlies coach <J.B. Bickerstaff/> got a $25,000 fine for telling one of his players to ignore official <Marc Davis/> on Wednesday night, then berating <Davis/> after being thrown out of the game. After several strange days filled with uncertainty, the Memphis Grizzlies ultimately decided not to trade guard <Tyreke Evans/>.

<Wright/>, 30, was in the final year of a three-year, $18 million deal with the Grizzlies. He was officially waived by Memphis on Saturday.

<Wright/> will become another lob target for Rockets duo <James Harden/> and <Chris Paul/>, providing depth behind starting center <Clint Capela/> along with <Nene/> and <Tarik Black/>. His ability to finish above the rim fits well with a Houston team that features two of the NBA's premier playmakers.

<Wright/> fell out of the Memphis rotation after being sidelined for close to a month by a groin injury, as the Grizzlies began to focus on developing young talent. He has a clean bill of health as he prepares to head to Houston.

A 6-foot-10 shot-blocker, <Wright/> is averaging 5.0 points and 3.4 rebounds in 27 games this season for Memphis.

The Rockets won 130-104 over the Denver Nuggets on Friday night to improve to 41-13, a half-game behind the Golden State Warriors for the NBA's best record.
