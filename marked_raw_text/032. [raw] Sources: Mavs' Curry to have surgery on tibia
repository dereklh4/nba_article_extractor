Dallas Mavericks guard Seth Curry will undergo season-ending surgery to repair a left tibia fracture, league sources told ESPN on Tuesday.

Curry, who has been sidelined with the injury since the preseason, will need a three-month recovery period. He's expected to be fully cleared and on the court before the start of July free agency.

He had a similar surgery on his right tibia during his senior season at Duke.

Curry was diagnosed with a stress reaction of his tibia in October. He had been projected to start alongside rookie guard Dennis Smith Jr. in Dallas' backcourt.

The 27-year-old Curry is the younger brother of Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry and son of former NBA guard Dell Curry.

In his best NBA season, Curry averaged 12.8 points and shot 48.1 percent from the floor and 42.5 percent from 3-point range in 70 games in 2016-17.
