Extension discussions between guard <Lou Williams/> and the LA Clippers have gathered significant momentum, and a new contract is within reach before Thursday afternoon's NBA trade deadline, league sources told ESPN.

Rival teams were increasingly resigned late Tuesday night that <Williams/>, 31, was exiting the trade market and returning to the Clippers on a multiyear contract, league sources said.

Eight big trades we'd like to see at the NBA deadline ESPN's NBA Insiders present eight trades they think should happen, involving five All-Stars and nine teams, including several title contenders. Lowe: What to expect and what could surprise at the NBA trade deadline Is there a deal out there to help the Cavs? Are the Warriors going to make a move? And what will happen with <DeAndre Jordan/> and <Marcus Smart/>? Here's the latest. NBA trade deadline: News and updates after the buzzer sounds The Cavaliers were the busiest team in the league ahead of the trade deadline. Get the latest intel from around the league right here.

<Williams/>' career season of 23.3 points per game, the Clippers' surprising team success and the stability of staying with an organization with which he has grown comfortable have pushed him toward the extension over chasing free agency this summer, league sources said.

Because of <Williams/>' stature as one of the most pursued players on the trade market, his looming commitment to remain with the Clippers could serve as an impetus to get a sluggish trade deadline into gear on Wednesday.

Losing <Williams/> off the trade market will likely intensify the pursuit for Memphis Grizzlies guard <Tyreke Evans/>, whom several teams have been separately pursuing. Memphis is trying to get a first-round pick for <Evans/>, and Boston, Denver and Philadelphia are among the teams most interested in acquiring <Evans/>.

<Williams/> is earning $7 million in the final year of his contract. He is having the best season of his career with the Clippers, averaging 23.3 points and 5.3 assists. Across 12 years with Philadelphia, Atlanta, Toronto, the Lakers and Houston, <Williams/> averaged 13.5 points.

The Clippers have discussed trade scenarios for center <DeAndre Jordan/>, but league sources said that so far, no traction exists on a deal, and there's a real possibility that <Jordan/> will finish the season with the Clippers. <Jordan/> can opt out of his contract this summer and become an unrestricted free agent.

After trading All-Star forward <Blake Griffin/> to the Detroit Pistons for a deal that included <Tobias Harris/> and <Avery Bradley/> going to Los Angeles, the Clippers are 27-25 and a half-game out of the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
