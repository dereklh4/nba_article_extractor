NEW ORLEANS -- Just when their season seemed to be spiraling downward, the New Orleans Pelicans have begun to figure out life after <DeMarcus Cousins/>.

Wednesday night's post-Mardi Gras home game against the Los Angeles Lakers will be a test of their newfound confidence.

The Pelicans (30-26), clinging to half-game lead over the L.A. Clippers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference, are coming off back-to-back road victories over the Brooklyn Nets and the Detroit Pistons, giving them a 3-5 record since <Cousins/> was lost for the season Jan. 26 with a torn left Achilles tendon.

In dispatching Detroit 118-103 on Monday night, the Pelicans got excellent contributions from their new "big three" -- forward <Anthony Davis/> (38 points and 10 rebounds), forward <Nikola Mirotic/> (21 points and 12 rebounds off the bench) and guard <Jrue Holiday/> (21 and 12).

Just as importantly, the offense that looked so stilted in losing five of six games without <Cousins/> caught fire, with 31 assists on 44 made field goals.

"It just takes a little while because <(Cousins)/> was such a big part of everything that we did," New Orleans coach <Alvin Gentry/> said. "We have guys who are adjusting to new roles, really. You just can't do that in one or two games. I think we're doing a good job of figuring things out now. The last two games we've played real solid basketball."

<Mirotic/> has been more than a perimeter shooter since being acquired from the Chicago Bulls after the <Cousins/> injury. He has attacked the boards and won <Davis/>' admiration for playing tough one-on-defense against Detroit forward <Blake Griffin/>, fronting him effectively and forcing him into several bad shots.

"<(Mirotic/> is) shooting well, rebounding extremely well, passing, playing great defense," said <Davis/>, who has scored 82 points himself in the last two games. "He's helping us a lot."

<Mirotic/> entered the Pistons' game off a 21-point, 16-rebound effort in a double-overtime victory over the Nets, but he was especially happy about his defense.

"I know it is an important area where I can improve," <Mirotic/> said. "I did a very good job this summer putting some more pounds on my body because I knew I had to be better. It's all effort. I know they are stronger than I, most of the time faster, but if you put in good energy, when you really want to do something, it's easier."

Despite losing 130-123 at Dallas on Saturday, the Lakers (23-32) are playing much better basketball. They had won four straight coming into that game, and newly acquired point guard <Isaiah Thomas/> came off the bench Saturday in his Lakers' debut and scored 22 points and had six assists in 31 minutes.

<Thomas/> is working his way back into shape after playing in 15 games for the Cleveland Cavaliers due to his rehabbing a hip injury for months. He went through a full-scale practice Monday, something he said he did not do in Cleveland.

"I mean, this is the first real practice I had all year," <Thomas/> said. "Let's see how my hip responds with the soreness and things like that, but I'm here. I'm here and I'm happy. Got my joy back and I'm ready to put on a show for the Lakers."

Lakers coach <Luke Walton/> said Tuesday rookie guard <Lonzo Ball/> went through his first practice since spraining the MCL in his left knee, but he probably will not return to the lineup until after the All-Star break. <Ball/> has missed the last 13 games.

<Walton/> said <Ball/> still is experiencing "a little discomfort," but he said it is not a "setback" in his recovery.

With a healthy <Cousins/> recording 22 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, the Pelicans defeated the Lakers 119-112 in Los Angeles on Oct. 22.
