<Jarrett Allen/> pokes the ball away from <Blake Griffin/> and <Allen Crabbe/> races ahead for an and-1 layup. (0:30)

DETROIT -- <Blake Griffin/> and the Detroit Pistons are on a roll heading into their matchup with his former team.

<Griffin/> scored 11 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, and <Andre Drummond/> added 17 points and 27 rebounds to lift the Pistons to their fifth straight victory, 115-106 over the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. Detroit hasn't lost since acquiring <Griffin/> last week in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers.

The Clippers play at Detroit on Friday night.

"Obviously, I know all those guys really well. I can't say that it's just another game," <Griffin/> said. "At the end of the day, we're trying to get wins, they're trying to get wins. I'm not really the type of guy to be all buddy-buddy during the game."

<Allen Crabbe/> had 19 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter for the Nets. They have lost four in a row and eight of nine.

"That's the <Allen/> we want," Nets coach <Kenny Atkinson/> said. "Just more aggressive, more assertive, and if that means he's going to take a few bad shots a game, then we're OK with that."

<Crabbe/> scored 16 of Brooklyn's points in a row during one fourth-quarter stretch, including a 3-pointer that cut Detroit's lead to three at 91-88. The Pistons put the ball in <Griffin/>'s hands after that, and he scored nine of their next 11.

"He took over," coach <Stan Van Gundy/> said. "He's done some good things since he's been here in the four games, but that was his best offense for us."

<Drummond/> had 12 rebounds in the first half and added 11 more in the third quarter. He finished with a season high, just two shy of his career best. It was the third time in the last five games he reached 20 rebounds.

He shot only 5 of 17 from the field, but that just meant more opportunities for offensive rebounds. He had seven of those. Despite all that, the Pistons were actually outrebounded as a team, 50-46.

Nets: Brooklyn was without <Quincy Acy/>, who was out because of a sprained right middle finger. ... The Nets went 17 of 51 from 3-point range. ... <Jarrett Allen/> had nine points in the fourth quarter and <Joe Harris/> had five. Those two and <Crabbe/> accounted for all of Brooklyn's scoring in the final period.

Pistons: Detroit had a huge advantage in turnovers, committing only seven while the Nets had 20. ... <Stanley Johnson/> had 19 points and <Ish Smith/> added 15.

The Pistons sent <Brice Johnson/>, one of the players they acquired in the trade for <Griffin/>, to the Grand Rapids Drive of the G League.

Brooklyn's <Spencer Dinwiddie/>, who used to play for the Pistons, made a last-second shot to give the Nets a win at Detroit last month. The Pistons kept him under control Wednesday. He scored 12 points and noticed how much different Detroit is with <Griffin/>.

"I think also, beyond <Blake/>, we gave up too many points off turnovers," <Dinwiddie/> said. "Any time a team goes out and gets baskets, it fuels a run."

Brooklyn came in averaging 44.4 points per game from its bench, but Detroit's reserves won that battle 30-15. <Langston Galloway/> had 13 points for the Pistons.

Nets: Host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday night.
