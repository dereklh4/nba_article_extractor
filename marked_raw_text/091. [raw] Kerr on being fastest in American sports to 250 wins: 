OAKLAND, Calif. -- Steve Kerr became the fastest coach to win 250 games after his team defeated the San Antonio Spurs 122-105 on Saturday night.

The Golden State Warriors head coach reached the 250 career mark in just 302 games, 44 faster than Phil Jackson's previous record. It's also the fewest games to 250 wins for any coach in the four major American professional sports leagues.

In his postgame address, Kerr downplayed his role in the feat.

"It just means that I inherited a hell of a team," Kerr said. "An amazing, talented group of players."

"It means he's got some good players," he replied in jest. "Nah, I'm just playing. That's incredible. Obviously, Steve never had any coaching experience, and to accomplish something like that says a lot. I think with the continuity that he brought to the organization, not only on the basketball court but just in the culture, has made a difference, and that's why we've been able to have the success that we've had."

Kerr became the fourth Warriors coach to secure 250 career victories, joining Al Attles, Don Nelson and Eddie Gottlieb. Luke Walton, former Warriors assistant and current head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, won 39 of those games when Kerr was sidelined for a period of time during the 2015-16 season.

"Obviously, [Steve] made the right decision [to coach the Warriors]," Stephen Curry said. "He was coveted coming out of the [television broadcast] booth. When he first got here, he really took his time implementing the system and perspective around how we're going to win and make that next step to a championship-winning team, as opposed to a playoff team that we had been a couple of years before.

"It's been an amazing 3 years, and hopefully more to come."

Kerr has led his team to three consecutive NBA Finals appearances and captured two titles. Now, Golden State has its sights set on winning back-to-back championships.

Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich, Kerr's mentor and the coach he defeated to get to 250, had very little to offer on the achievement.

"I don't care," Popovich said. "And I can tell you that he doesn't care, either."
