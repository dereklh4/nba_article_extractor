Melo says it's too early to tell if he'll play Thursday (0:52)

OAKLAND, Calif. -- Carmelo Anthony left Tuesday's 125-105 win over the Golden State Warriors just six minutes in and did not return because of a sprained right ankle.

The Oklahoma City Thunder power forward initially remained in the game and was said to be available to return after going to the locker room to get his ankle re-taped. His ankle proved to be sorer than previously thought, however, and Anthony was ruled out for the rest of the game.

Westbrook comes out blazing as OKC blows out Warriors With Russell Westbrook setting the tone early and Paul George carrying the momentum, the Thunder snapped out of their slide in impressive fashion.

"I kind of backed up on [Stephen Curry] after the shot. I backed up and his foot was behind me, and I rolled my ankle on his foot," Anthony said. "It was inadvertent."

Anthony finished with zero points on 0 of 4 shooting and an assist in six minutes.

Asked how he was feeling, Anthony said, "Like I've got an ankle sprain."

The Thunder play the Lakers in Los Angeles on Thursday, and Anthony said it's too early to tell if he'll be available for that one.

"I've got to get on this flight, get round-the-clock treatment tonight and tomorrow," Anthony said. "Thursday is a long, long time away from now, so we'll see what happens. I'm pretty sure you guys will know of any decisions that are made."

Patrick Patterson started the second half in place of Anthony, but OKC coach Billy Donovan said he'll reevaluate his starting five before making a decision for Thursday's contest.

"We'll have to look at that. I don't want to get ahead of myself there," Donovan said. "Both of those two guys [Patterson and Jerami Grant] can play the power forward spot."
