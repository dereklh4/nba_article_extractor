Malcolm Brogdon appears to hurt his left leg on a dunk attempt in the second quarter and, after play stops, he's helped to the locker room, favoring his leg. Brogdon was later diagnosed with a left quadriceps injury. (0:46)

Milwaukee Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon, the reigning NBA Rookie of the Year, suffered a left quad tendon strain in Thursday night's 108-89 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in Minneapolis.

Brogdon was on crutches with a stabilizing cast on his left leg after the game. He will undergo further tests Friday.

Brogdon, who was starting in place of Eric Bledsoe, had to be helped from the court after appearing to suffer a noncontact injury on a dunk attempt in the second quarter.

Also after Thursday's game, Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo said he twisted his left ankle pretty badly in the fourth quarter.

Antetokounmpo said he was having trouble putting weight on the ankle and was walking with a limp. He also will be evaluated Friday before the Bucks play the Knicks.

Brogdon became the only player who was not a first-round draft pick to win the Rookie of the Year award last season, beating out the Philadelphia 76ers duo of Joel Embiid and Dario Saric.

Brogdon is averaging 13.5 points, 3.3 assists and 3.4 rebounds this season for the Bucks, who will get forward Jabari Parker back on Friday.

Parker hasn't played in almost a year, since tearing an ACL on Feb. 8 in a game against Miami.
