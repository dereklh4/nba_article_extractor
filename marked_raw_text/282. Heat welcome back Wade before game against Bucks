With Miami ahead by 4 points, <Dwyane Wade/> shows off his defensive skills and denies <Eric Bledsoe/> from scoring. (0:20)

MIAMI --  A quiet night for <Dwyane Wade/> on the stat sheet still produced plenty of loud moments in his first game back with the Heat.

<Wade/> received a standing ovation when he entered the game off the bench in the first quarter and the crowd roared when he came up with a key block late in the game.

There were other moments throughout as <Wade/>'s mere presence got a rise out of Heat fans, and teammates <Hassan Whiteside/> and <Tyler Johnson/> led the way to a 91-85 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday that snapped a five-game losing streak and capped a celebratory night.

"It felt like a playoff game," <Whiteside/> said. "The fans were in an uproar. It felt like a playoff game and Miami was just rocking. It hadn't felt like that in a while here."

<Wade/> scored three points on 1-of-6 shooting with two assists, one rebound, a key late block, and four turnovers in 22 minutes. He was acquired in a trade from Cleveland on Thursday. <Wade/> played 13 seasons and won three NBA championships with the Heat before leaving for Chicago as a free agent in 2016.

"I would love to go 6 for 6, but I was just trying to get used to everything so I wasn't worried about that," <Wade/> said. "I was worried about getting the win. I felt like I did some positive things on the basketball floor and I felt like I did some negative things on the basketball floor, but I tried to make winning ways defensively and offensively when I got an opportunity and that's what it's all about. I'll definitely get better and I'll definitely score the ball more and all of those things at some point. Tonight I thought was a success because we got the W."

Even with the anxiety and excitement circulating the arena, <Wade/> was relatively calm and free of nerves.

"I was telling <Spo/> (coach <Erik Spoelstra/>) after the game that I actually felt normal," <Wade/> said. "He said he felt a little weird seeing me on the bench to start the game, but I actually felt normal. Once the game starts, it becomes a game and you get into it."

<Johnson/> scored 19 points and Whiteside scored 12 points and had 16 rebounds. <Bam Adebayo/> added 15 points and 10 rebounds, and <Josh Richardson/> chipped in 16 points for Miami, which received the jolt <Wade/> hoped with his arrival.

"What a terrific day, the last 24 hours and then to culminate in a win like this after five straight losses, it's what our organization needed for the moment," <Spoelstra/> said. "Obviously it was special to have <Dwyane/> back in uniform, back on our side in front of the home fans. It felt exactly the way it should. It felt normal. It felt like home. It felt like family. It felt all the things you came to expect with <Dwyane/>."

All-Star <Giannis Antetokounmpo/> scored a game-high 23 points to lead the Bucks, who lost for just the second time in nine games under interim head coach <Joe Prunty/>.

"It was a good atmosphere to play the game," <Prunty/> said. "You would expect that, something you would anticipate."

The Heat trailed 9-0 to start the game, with fans growing restless to see the return of the franchise's favorite son. They chanted, "We want <Wade/>!"

"The chants kind of started a little too early," <Wade/> laughed. "I was like no, not right now, not right now."

<Wade/> entered midway through the first quarter and received a standing ovation from the crowd. He immediately made an impact throwing a lob to <Whiteside/> for a dunk on his first possession as the fans roared.

Minutes later, <Wade/> took his first shot, a 3 from the right wing, and drilled it bringing the crowd to its feet.

"This is kind of environment we've got to get used to playing in," <Wade/> said. "It was good. From start to finish the crowd was amazing. I definitely miss this crowd. I saw a lot of familiar faces."

There were other moments in the first half, too. A no-look alley-oop pass in transition to <Johnson/> for a dunk and another lob to <Whiteside/> for a dunk.

"It was exciting," <Whiteside/> said. "He's a Hall of Fame talent. His IQ is amazing so he knows when to look at the spots and knows when to throw it and make the right decisions."

Milwaukee was able to cut the deficit to 85-78 with 1:28 left.

More "We want <Wade"/> chants rang out in the closing minutes with <Wade/> on the bench as the Bucks inched closer. <Eric Bledsoe/> hit a 3 to pull the Bucks within 85-81.

After a turnover by <Richardson/>, <Wade/> blocked a layup attempt by <Bledsoe/> and <Wayne Ellington/> drilled a 3 to help seal the victory.

"I got a chance to time it and it felt like old times," <Wade/> said.

Bucks: <John Henson/> (hamstring) returned after a one-game absence. <Henson/> was hit with a technical foul in the first quarter when he slammed the scorer's table in frustration. ... The Bucks are allowing 95.4 points in <Prunty/>'s nine games as interim head coach.

Heat: <Kelly Olynyk/> (left shoulder strain) missed his second consecutive game. . The Heat were able to include Wade and <Luke Babbitt/>, who was acquired in a trade on Thursday, in their new "Vice" intro video with <Wade/> smiling at the end drawing a loud cheer from the fans. . <Goran Dragic/> was presented with the Euroscar European Player of the Year award before the game.

<LeBron James/> weighed in on <Wade/> returning to the Heat:

"I'm happy as hell for <D-Wade/>. He gets to go back home and that's how it should be. I've always felt like that's where his heart and his mind was and I think it's going to be great for him. I look forward to seeing the footage of him being announced tonight back in Miami. But, obviously, it's always, when it's your brother and you're around him every day and he has to go back . but at the end of the day, it wasn't tough. We're both 15 years in the league. We know how the business is and more importantly, we see each other all the time, anyway. So, get out of here, <D-Wade."/>
