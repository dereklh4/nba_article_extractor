Lakers PG <Isaiah Thomas/> says he is focused on helping Los Angeles come together as a team and is not looking back at his brief time with the Cavaliers. (0:21)

<Isaiah Thomas/> will come off the bench when he makes his Los Angeles Lakers debut Saturday night against the Dallas Mavericks.

Lakers coach <Luke Walton/> confirmed Saturday afternoon to reporters that he did not plan to make any changes to his starting lineup. <Walton/> and <Thomas/> had dinner together in Dallas on Friday and discussed expectations and roles, sources told ESPN.

<Magic Johnson/> said he wouldn't have made Thursday's trade with Cleveland if he wasn't confident the Lakers could lure two stars to Los Angeles in free agency, this offseason and/or in 2019. How (and when) the Lakers can add two superstars after a big trade It's now certain that Los Angeles will be a major player in free agency. The only question: what year?

The plan is for <Thomas/> to eventually work himself into position to join the starting five, according to sources.

A 2017 All-NBA second team performer who continues to work himself back into form after a hip injury, <Thomas/> also didn't start his first game with the Cleveland Cavaliers when they hosted the Portland Trail Blazers on Jan. 2.

"This is about <Isaiah/> and what he can do to help this young team continue to grow and to win," <Thomas/>' agent, <Aaron Goodwin/>, told ESPN on Saturday morning. "He's met with <Luke/> and [assistant coach] <Brian Shaw/> and he understands the direction of the team, and wants to come in and contribute the right way. Everything else will work itself out."

The Lakers' franchise rookie point guard <Lonzo Ball/> could return from an MCL sprain after the All-Star break. Cleveland traded <Thomas/>, <Channing Frye/> and a 2018 first-round pick for <Jordan Clarkson/> and <Larry Nance Jr./> on Thursday.

<Thomas/>, 29, will be an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of this season. It sounds as if the Lakers will grant <Thomas/> every opportunity to be productive.

"We need a point guard," said <Magic Johnson/>, the Lakers' president of basketball operations. "So especially with that type of experience and the fact that he can score the basketball and pass it, we want to get <[Thomas]/> in here fast. We told him that.

"He's day-to-day, <[Ball]/> is. We don't know when he's coming back. We need somebody to come in there and lead our troops. <[Brandon Ingram/> has] been doing a fabulous job but we've gotta get another guy in here. That's why <IT/> was important for us to make this move. And also, a veteran that can also help <Lonzo/>. 'This is what you need to look for in when you're playing against this guy. This is what I've been doing in terms of my regimen of when I work out.' All those things -- we didn't have anybody to teach <Lonzo/> anything. Hopefully <IT/> can come in and do that."

In 15 games this season, <Thomas/> is averaging 14.7 points and 4.5 assists. Last season for the Boston Celtics, he averaged 28.9 points per game while shooting 46 percent from the field.
