After a season in the China Basketball Association, guard Ty Lawson has emerged as a serious candidate for a deal with the Washington Wizards, league sources told ESPN.

The Wizards are still considering several point guards, including Derrick Rose, Briante Weber and Ramon Sessions, league sources said.

Nevertheless, Lawson's strong performance with Shandong of the CBA, including 55 points in his final game, has merited deeper inspection, league sources said. Lawson is expected to get the opportunity prior to the All-Star break to make a case to Washington about signing him, league sources said.

Washington is searching for another point guard in the wake of All-Star John Wall's left knee surgery.

Lawson, 30, was one of the top young point guards in the NBA with the Denver Nuggets, until issues -- including alcohol-related arrests -- derailed his tenure with the team. Lawson played six years with Denver, averaging 14.2 points and 6.6 assists, until he was traded to the Houston Rockets in 2015. He had stops with Indiana and Sacramento until receiving no NBA offer this summer forced him to pursue a deal in China.

Lawson was the 18th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft out of North Carolina.
