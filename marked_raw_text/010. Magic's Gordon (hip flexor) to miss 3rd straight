Orlando Magic forward <Aaron Gordon/> will miss his third straight game Saturday against the Washington Wizards because of a strained left hip flexor, the team announced.

<Gordon/> is averaging a team-leading 18.4 points per game this season. It was announced Friday that he would be returning to compete in the Slam Dunk contest during NBA All-Star Weekend for a third time.

He attempted to go through a practice Friday, but he was forced to exit with some lingering pain in the hip.

<Marreese Speights/> started in place of <Gordon/> in Wednesday's win over the Lakers, so both he and <Wesley Iwundu/> will be in line for increased minutes Saturday.
