After being traded by the Cavaliers back to the Heat, <Dwyane Wade/> played his first game back in Miami, where longtime fans were overjoyed to see him help the Heat to a 91-85 win over the Bucks. (1:03)

MIAMI -- As the Heat fell behind early against the Milwaukee Bucks, the Miami fans were getting eager to see the man of the night.

<Dwyane Wade/> was back with the Heat on Friday night, coming off the bench for Miami.

As the Heat fell behind 9-0, the crowd chanted, "We want <Wade/>!"

<Wade/> took the court midway through the first quarter as the fans gave him a standing ovation. He immediately grabbed a defensive rebound and threw a lob pass to <Hassan Whiteside/>, who was able to slam home a dunk.

<Wade/> played 22 minutes in Miami's 91-85 win over the Bucks, contributing 3 points, 2 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 blocks and 2 steals. The win over the Bucks snapped the Heat's five-game losing streak.

"Great energy in the building," <Wade/> said. "When I went out to warm up, it was definitely a playoff atmosphere.

"The crowd was amazing. I missed this crowd."

<Wade/> is Miami's all-time leader in points, games, assists and steals. He was drafted in the first round by Miami in 2003 but left for the Chicago Bulls in 2016, then signed with Cleveland in 2017. Miami acquired him from Cleveland as part of the Cavaliers' deadline-day makeover.

His return seemed to put everybody within the franchise in a good mood Friday, from office workers to head coach <Erik Spoelstra/>.

Before the game, <Wade/> predicted, "It's going to be a great environment."

"It felt like a playoff game," said <Whiteside/>, who had 12 points and 16 rebounds on Friday. "The fans were in an uproar. It felt like a playoff game, and Miami was just rocking. It hadn't felt like that in a while here."

The lower bowl was full before tipoff, an uncommon sight for a typical Heat regular-season game, as fans waited to see their superstar come off the bench.

But no one really saw this coming, not even <Spoelstra/>.

Before Thursday's practice, <Spoelstra/> received updates on possible trades in team president <Pat Riley/>'s office. <Riley/> informed him there was a possibility to acquire <Luke Babbitt/> and also <Wade/>.

<Spoelstra/> was about to leave <Riley/>'s office when the news sank in.

"What?" <Spoelstra/> said. "<Dwyane/> who?"

<Riley/> explained to <Spoelstra/> about the player movement in the league and that a <Wade/> deal could potentially happen.

"We'll let you know by the end of practice," <Riley/> said.

The coach said, "My only response was, 'Let's go, let's do it.' But it was probably not something any of us foresaw two weeks ago. Crazy things happen in this league, so it just absolutely felt like perfect timing for both parties, and it was actually surreal how quickly it came about."

<Wade/> could hardly wait. But even with the anxiety and excitement circulating the arena on Friday, he was relatively calm and free of nerves.

"I was telling [head coach] <Spo/> after the game that I actually felt normal," <Wade/> said. "He said he felt a little weird seeing me on the bench to start the game, but I actually felt normal. Once the game starts, it becomes a game and you get into it."

<Spoelstra/> remarked that <Wade/>'s return and Friday night's victory were what the Heat "needed for the moment."

"Obviously it was special to have <Dwyane/> back in uniform, back on our side in front of the home fans," <Spoelstra/> said. "It felt exactly the way it should. It felt normal. It felt like home. It felt like family. It felt all the things you came to expect with Dwyane.''
