DETROIT -- Quincy Acy sat out for the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night against the Pistons because of a sprained right middle finger.

The Nets also were without Caris LeVert, who was evaluated for a possible concussion after being knocked out of Tuesday night's game against the Houston Rockets by a pick from Nene Hilario.

The Pistons still are without point guard Reggie Jackson, who is sidelined because of a sprained right ankle.

Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game that LeVert was still being evaluated. He also is listed with a sprained right knee.
