PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia center Joel Embiid sat out the 76ers' 104-102 win Wednesday night over Miami because of soreness in his right ankle.

Scheduled to start for the Eastern Conference in the All-Star game this weekend, Embiid had 17 points in a victory over New York on Monday night. Also Monday, the 7-footer was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week after averaging 26.7 points, 15 rebounds and 2.3 blocks last week as the 76ers went 3-0.

The 76ers are seventh place in the Eastern Conference, ahead of the eighth-place Heat.
