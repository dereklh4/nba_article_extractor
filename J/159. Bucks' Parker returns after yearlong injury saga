After missing the past year due to a torn ACL, <Jabari Parker/> receives a standing ovation as he returns to the court for the Bucks. (0:26)

MILWAUKEE -- For the first time in almost a year, Bucks forward <Jabari Parker/> was back playing in an NBA game and enjoying all the love showered upon him after he dealt with the second serious knee injury of his career.

<Parker/>, who tore his left ACL for the second time on Feb. 8, 2017, scored 12 points in 15 minutes as Milwaukee squeaked out a 92-90 win over the New York Knicks on Friday night. After it was over, the softspoken 22-year-old took his latest return in stride.

"It felt great," <Parker/> said. "But honestly, training myself to think about it as just getting better. It's not going to take just one game, a few games, just the whole process. That game didn't really stick out as much as people perceive it to be."

It did to the teammates, coaches and fans who watched <Parker/> go through a grueling rehab process to get back on the floor. When <Parker/> checked into the game for <Giannis Antetokounmpo/> with 5:25 left in the first quarter, the crowd at the BMO Harris Bradley Center gave the Chicago native a standing ovation.

"I'm proud of him," Bucks teammate <Khris Middleton/> said. "It's tough to go through what he went through twice, then come back and play like nothing's ever happened. It's great. I know there was a lot going through his mind, but he did a great job of just going out there and playing basketball."

The Bucks are optimistic that <Parker/> can pair up with <Antetokounmpo/> down the stretch of the season and provide the consistent offensive option the team has been searching for all season.

"It was a great feeling," <Antetokounmpo/> said of seeing <Parker/> on the floor. "Everybody was really excited about <JP/> coming back tonight. Most importantly, he was just playing, having fun. It's just great to see him out there competing with us again."

<Lowe/>: Can these Bucks be great? They're running out of time to find out <Jabari Parker/> is back, and <Jason Kidd/> is gone. <Zach Lowe/> looks at what's next for a team with one superstar and lots of questions. <Malcolm Brogdon/> will miss six to eight weeks with a partially torn left quadriceps tendon, the Bucks said Friday.

As usual, it was <Antetokounmpo/> who led the way for the Bucks, scoring 29 points, including the game-winner in the lane with 1.9 seconds left, but it was <Parker/> who had the spotlight on this night.

"It's good to see one of your brothers go through what he went through and then get the standing ovation that he got," <Middleton/> said. "He loves this city, so it's only right that this city loves him back."

Bucks interim coach <Joe Prunty/> did not reveal when <Parker/>'s restriction of around 15 minutes per game would be extended, but he noted there is a plan for progression in place.

"I thought he had a very good debut," <Prunty/> said. "I thought there were a lot of positive things that he did out on the floor. One of the things we talked about a lot, there are certain things he does naturally. He can score the ball, he can make plays for himself and other people. But I thought defensively he was solid, was in the right spots. Again, there's a rhythm and timing to the game every time you step out there, and it's difficult when you've been off for a while, and I thought he did a really nice job of fitting in and helping the team win the game."

<Parker/>'s next test comes Sunday in a matinee against the Brooklyn Nets.

"[The] only way to go here is going up," <Parker/> said. "You can't beat the low of any point that I've been at any stage of these few months. Anything that I do from this point on is just to go up, and that's a blessing."
