CHICAGO -- Bulls point guard <Kris Dunn/> will play Wednesday against the Toronto Raptors after missing the past 11 games because of concussion-like symptoms.

"I'm going to go out there and play a couple minutes," <Dunn/> said after Wednesday's practice. "See how my body's feeling."

<Dunn/> suffered a concussion and cracked teeth after landing on his face after finishing a dunk in a Jan. 17 loss to the Golden State Warriors. Bulls head coach <Fred Hoiberg/> noted that <Dunn/> would start Wednesday's game but would only play about 20 minutes and likely wouldn't play in the fourth quarter.

"The plan for <Kris/> tonight is pretty similar to what we did with <Zach [LaVine]/> when he first got back in the lineup," <Hoiberg/> said. "Obviously with <Kris Dunn/> we're not dealing with a soft tissue injury like we were with <Zach/>, so it will be a little bit different in that regard. I imagine he'll get pretty winded, especially when he's out there early in the game. We will start him tonight, then we just need to monitor him, see how he's doing."

As long as <Dunn/> comes out of Wednesday's game feeling good, he is expected to play in Friday night's Rising Stars Challenge at All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles. <Hoiberg/> acknowledged that Dunn will also have a minutes restriction in the exhibition game.

"He can't go out there in that game and play 30-plus minutes. But at the same time, I'm excited for him, I'm excited for <Lauri [Markkanen]/> to go out and experience that weekend. It's hopefully something that they can go out and enjoy themselves. Have some fun, decompress a little bit. But <Kris/>, I'm [going to tell him] if somebody's on a breakaway, let's not sprint back. Let's just stay at half court and try to get a dunk in."

<Hoiberg/> says <Dunn/> has worked through the soreness phase of practicing, having gone through a few workouts with the Bulls' G-League affiliate. The third-year coach is also looking forward to seeing <Dunn/>, <LaVine/> and rookie <Lauri Markkanen/> on the floor together. The trio has only played three games together this season.

For his part, <Dunn/> is excited about having the chance to take his family out to Los Angeles for the All-Star festivities.

"[My sister] wants to see all the celebrities," <Dunn/> said. "<Lil Uzi/>, <Kanye West/>, the <Kardashians/>, all the stuff you see on the TV. So hopefully they get to see them. I told her, 'If you see them, go get that picture somehow. Now, if anybody puts their hands on you, I got you.'"
