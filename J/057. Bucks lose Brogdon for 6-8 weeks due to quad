<Malcolm Brogdon/> appears to hurt his left leg on a dunk attempt in the second quarter and, after play stops, he's helped to the locker room, favoring his leg. <Brogdon/> was later diagnosed with a left quadriceps injury. (0:46)

The Milwaukee Bucks say guard <Malcolm Brogdon/> will miss six to eight weeks with a partially torn left quadriceps tendon.

An MRI revealed the extent of the injury Friday.

<Lowe/>: Can these Bucks be great? They're running out of time to find out <Jabari Parker/> is back, and <Jason Kidd/> is gone. <Zach Lowe/> looks at what's next for a team with one superstar and lots of questions.

<Brogdon/>, the reigning NBA Rookie of the Year, had to be helped from the court after an uncontested layup attempt in the second quarter of Thursday's loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

<Brogdon/> is averaging 13.3 points, 3.2 assists and 3.3 rebounds this season. Last year, he became the only non-first-round winner of the Rookie of the Year award, beating out the Philadelphia 76ers duo of <Joel Embiid/> and <Dario Saric/>.

"It's unfortunate that he got hurt," Bucks interim coach <Joe Prunty/> said. "We understand that it's part of the game and we know that. He's tough minded and he'll battle through this. We'll move forward and we talked about it a lot -- the next guy be ready to play."

The injury comes at a time when Milwaukee (27-23) is set to get <Jabari Parker/> back from a knee injury Friday against the New York Knicks. <Parker/> was the second overall pick in the 2014 draft, but tore his left ACL for a second time last February and hasn't played since.

Atlanta Hawks forward <Taurean Prince/> will replace <Brogdon/> on the U.S. Team in the Feb. 16 Rising Stars event on NBA All-Star weekend.
