OKLAHOMA CITY -- <Russell Westbrook/> and <Carmelo Anthony/> both sat out their second consecutive game with sprained ankles on Sunday, during the Oklahoma City Thunder' 110-92 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.

<Westbrook/> and <Anthony/> were late scratches in both games, going through workouts prior to the Thunder's game Thursday against the Los Angeles Lakers and Sunday's game against Memphis. Their official status for Tuesday's game against the remodeled Cleveland Cavaliers is unknown, with an update expected after practice on Monday.

"<Russ/> was in there this morning working a little bit, trying to move around, getting some treatment," Thunder coach <Billy Donovan/> said. "Both those guys will continue to do that."

Both suffered their injuries against the Warriors last Tuesday. <Anthony/> rolling his right ankle six minutes into the game by stepping on <Stephen Curry/>'s foot. <Westbrook/> sprained his left in the second half though he remained in the game.

Against the Lakers, the Thunder struggled to score consistently, managing just 81 points in a blowout loss, but improved against the Grizzlies scoring 110 while tying an OKC-era record for made 3-points (16). <Paul George/> led the way with 33 points and eight assists, with <Alex Abrines/> adding 16.

"It was fun to go out to battle with those guys, I think more so just doing it together with three of our soldiers down," <George/> said. "It was fun to take on thus challenge, to stay with that winning spirit here regardless of who's in or who's out."

<George/> said with a game and a practice under his belt, he felt much more comfortable as the focal point of the Thunder's offense, playing much of it at point guard.

"I looked back at the Lakers' game on different things, but I wanted to see what I was missing, what opportunities I was missing," <George/> said. "I thought I was a little out of my character with how I was trying to play. I thought tonight, I got in my rhythm and stayed in my rhythm and played my game. Second game being together, that group, I thought there was a little more chemistry."

Against the Lakers in Los Angeles, fans chanted "We want <Paul/>!" at <George/> during the second half, with him saying after the game he didn't hear the chants. <George/>, a native of Southern California and unrestricted free agent this summer, is viewed as a primary offseason target for the Lakers. In response, Thunder fans chanted "We want <Paul/>" every trip <George/> made to the free throw line against the Grizzlies on Sunday.
