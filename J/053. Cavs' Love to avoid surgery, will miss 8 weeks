Cleveland Cavaliers forward <Kevin Love/> will not need surgery on his fractured left hand and will miss approximately eight weeks, the team announced Friday.

The All-Star suffered the non-displaced fracture in the fifth metacarpal in the first quarter of the Cavs' 125-114 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday. Instead of surgery, <Love/> will undergo rehabilitation to repair the injury.

Cavs happy to put rough January behind them With struggles on the court and squabbles off of it -- not to mention the injury to Kevin Love -- the Cavaliers figure things can only get better as the calendar turns. The timing of <Kevin Love/>'s broken hand could not have been much worse. How could Cleveland's front office react with the trade deadline approaching?

<Love/> visited Dr. <Michelle Carlson/> at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York on Thursday. He was accompanied by the Cavs' medical team, including team physician Dr. <James Rosneck/>, and Dr. <Steven Maschke/> of Cleveland Clinic Sports Health.

<Love/> is Cleveland's leading rebounder (9.4 per game) and second-leading scorer (17.9 points per game).

The Cavaliers won their first game without <Love/>, beating Miami on Wednesday. They next will host the Houston Rockets on Saturday.

<Love/> underwent surgery on the same hand in October 2009. That procedure required three screws to be inserted.

He was selected as a reserve for this year's All-Star Game but was replaced by Miami's <Goran Dragic/> on Thursday. The All-Star Game will be played Feb. 18 in Los Angeles.
