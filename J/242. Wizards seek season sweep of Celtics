After his former team overhauled the roster at the trade deadline, <Kyrie Irving/> has little to say when asked about what the Cavs did. (0:14)

WASHINGTON -- Two days after Boston lost to the team chasing the Celtics atop the Eastern Conference standings, guard <Kyrie Irving/> wasn't about to let his team suffer another defeat.

<Irving/> scored 12 of Boston's last 17 points and finished with 28 to help the Celtics remain in sole possession of the East lead with a 110-104 overtime victory over the Washington Wizards on Thursday night.

"Every game for us is a learning experience, and it's almost like a `must-win," <Irving/> said after his second game back from a thigh injury. "Just based on the amount of expectations and what we put on ourselves and one another on a game-to-game basis."

<Jaylen Brown/> added five of his 18 points in overtime for Boston. The Celtics have won five of six, and remained a game ahead of Toronto in the race for the East's top playoff seed after the Raptors' win over New York earlier Thursday. The Raptors beat the Celtics 111-91 in Toronto on Tuesday.

<Otto Porter/> had 27 points and 11 rebounds for Washington, and <Bradley Beal/> had 18 points and matched his career high with nine assists.

But as <John Wall/> remains sidelined following knee surgery, the Wizards committed 22 turnovers and shot just 2 for 12 in the overtime period, dropping their second straight game after winning five straight.

<Beal/>, who shot just 7 of 27 and took only one foul shot, suggested officiating played a role.

"It's crazy," he said of his lack of free throws. "Because I feel like I'm being just as aggressive as everybody else out there. My teammates are doing the same. Sometimes we don't get rewarded."

Meanwhile, <Irving/> went 9 of 10 from the foul line. And after Boston allowed Washington to come back from a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit, he tied it from the line with 9.8 seconds remaining in regulation on three made foul shots after luring <Markieff Morris/> into a foul on a 3-point attempt.

"Nowhere near a foul," <Morris/> said. "(The referee) was behind me. I don't know how could see me swiping down on the ball and me hitting his arm. If I hit his arm, there's no way he would get the shot up."

Said <Irving/>: "I just don't want to get into the whole `whether it was a foul or not.' I don't want to get fined."

That was part of 10 straight points for <Irving/> before finding <Brown/> for a layup that made it 105-103 with 2:32 left in overtime.

<Brown/> stretched the lead to five when he hit a contested baseline 3-pointer less than a minute later, and the Wizards missed their last five shots.

Celtics: Signed and activated free agent C <Greg Monroe/>, but did not make a trade at the NBA trade deadline. ... Coach <Brad Stevens/> wasn't surprised. "It was probably the least amount of time that I was paying attention to it or on the phone over these days in five years," he said. ... <Monroe/> was one of three Celtics players to receive a technical foul in separate incidents, along with F <Marcus Morris/> and G <Terry Rozier/>

Wizards: Traded G/F <Sheldon Mac/> to the Atlanta Hawks for a 2019 second-round pick in a move coach <Scott Brooks/> said gave Washington the flexibility to sign one or two players. "We're definitely looking," <Brooks/> said. ... <Mac/> (torn Achilles), who was then waived by Atlanta, has not played this season. ... F <Kelly Oubre/> received a technical foul in the fourth quarter.

Although the Wizards won their first five games after losing G <John Wall/> to knee surgery, <Brooks/> denied the notion his absence has been a positive.

"He knows how I feel about him," <Brooks/> said. "He knows how the organization, his teammates feel about him. And for anyone to think that we're not better with <John/>, that's for clickbait."

After reaching a buyout agreement with Phoenix, Louisiana native <Monroe/> said he also considered signing with the New Orleans Pelicans after they lost C <DeMarcus Cousins/> to a torn Achilles in January. "They obviously had a need there at my position," <Monroe/> said. "It's home for me. So it was definitely a tough decision. But it was hard to resist here."

Celtics: Play Indiana on Friday night in the first of three at home.
