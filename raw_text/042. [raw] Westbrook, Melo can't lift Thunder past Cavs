OKLAHOMA CITY -- Thunder stars Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony returned to action Tuesday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers after recovering from sprained ankles, but it wasn't enough as the Cavaliers posted a 120-112 victory.

Westbrook scored 21 points and added seven rebounds and 12 assists in 39 minutes. Anthony had 24 points and seven boards in 36 minutes.

Westbrook had been nursing a sprained left ankle. He missed Oklahoma City's loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 8 and the win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday. The All-Star point guard led the Thunder with 25.5 points, 10.3 assists and 9.3 rebounds per game entering the night.

Anthony sprained his right ankle early in Oklahoma City's win over the Golden State Warriors on Feb. 6, and he sat out against the Lakers and Grizzlies. The veteran forward ranks third on the team with 17 points per game.
