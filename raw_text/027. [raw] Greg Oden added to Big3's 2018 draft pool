Former NBA No. 1 overall pick Greg Oden was added to the Big3's draft pool for its second season in 2018, the league announced Monday.

Oden was taken No. 1 overall by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2007 draft but played just three NBA seasons as his career was derailed by injuries. Kevin Durant was selected No. 2 overall by the Seattle SuperSonics.

He played in just 82 games for the Trail Blazers and was waived by the team in 2012.

Oden, 30, last played in the NBA in 2013-14, when he appeared in 23 games for the Miami Heat.

In 2016, he told ESPN's Jeff Goodman that "I'll be remembered as the biggest bust in NBA history." He said then his playing days were over.

He is currently a student assistant coach for his alma mater, Ohio State, on Chris Holtmann's staff.
