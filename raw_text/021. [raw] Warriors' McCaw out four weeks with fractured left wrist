Golden State guard Patrick McCaw suffered a small fracture in his left wrist and will be out approximately four weeks, the team announced.

McCaw suffered a non-displaced fracture in his left wrist during Monday night's win over Phoenix, the team said. His left wrist will be in a cast for 10 days and he will be re-evaluated in four weeks. McCaw has played 51 games for the Warriors this season, averaging 15.6 minutes, 3.9 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists.

He has struggled in his second season with the Warriors and in January asked Golden State coach Steve Kerr if he could be assigned to the G League to work out some problems. He played several games for the Santa Cruz Warriors.
