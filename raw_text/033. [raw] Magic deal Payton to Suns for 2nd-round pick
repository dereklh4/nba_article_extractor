The Orlando Magic have traded point guard Elfrid Payton to the Phoenix Suns for a 2018 second-round pick, the teams announced Thursday.

How does the former Magic point guard project in Phoenix? Kevin Pelton grades the trade.

Payton, the No. 10 overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, is averaging 13.0 points, 6.3 assists and 4.0 rebounds per game this season.

The second-round pick going to Phoenix was originally acquired by the Magic in the Troy Daniels trade with Memphis.

With Payton scheduled to be a free agent next season, the Magic didn't want to lose him for nothing.

He will give the Suns depth in the backcourt, which is needed right now with Devin Booker dealing with a hip injury and Tyler Ulis nursing back pain.
