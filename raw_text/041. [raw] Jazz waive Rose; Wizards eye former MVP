Former NBA MVP Derrick Rose, whom the Utah Jazz acquired as part of a three-way trade Thursday, was released by the team Saturday.

The Washington Wizards are one team expected to survey the possibility of signing Rose, league sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. The Wizards' John Wall still has several more weeks of rehab following knee surgery, and backup point guard Tim Frazier is set for surgery Sunday to repair a broken nose suffered during Saturday's 101-90 win over the Chicago Bulls, sources told ESPN's Chris Haynes.

The 29-year-old Rose, who was traded by the Cleveland Cavaliers to Utah in a deal that also involved the Sacramento Kings prior to the NBA trade deadline Thursday, is averaging 9.8 points and 1.6 assists per game this season.

He struggled to find his way in his only season with the Cavaliers, appearing in just 16 games while battling injuries and inconsistency.

Rose, the 2009 Rookie of the Year and 2011 MVP while with the Bulls, has averaged 19.2 points, 5.8 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game over his nine seasons.
