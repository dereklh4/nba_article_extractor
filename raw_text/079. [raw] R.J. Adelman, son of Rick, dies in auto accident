HOUSTON -- The son of former NBA coach Rick Adelman was killed in an auto-pedestrian accident in downtown Houston.

Police say 44-year-old Richard "R.J." Adelman was not using a crosswalk to cross the street when he was struck and killed Feb. 2 by a minivan. No charges were filed against the driver.

Adelman had been an assistant on his father's staff when the elder Adelman coached the Houston Rockets from 2007 to '11. He also was player personnel director for the Minnesota Timberwolves when his father coached there, and worked on staffs in Sacramento, Seattle and Portland.

Kings general manager Vlade Divac said he was "beyond heartbroken" upon hearing the news.

"I was fortunate to work with R.J. for several years during my playing days in Sacramento and grew to respect him profoundly on many levels. He will be remembered as a loyal son, friend and multi-talented professional who followed his heart into basketball alongside his father after a successful law career," Divac said in a statement released by the Kings.

Adelman grew up in Oregon, where his father coached the Portland Trail Blazers to the NBA Finals. He helped Willamette University win the 1993 NAIA Division II national championship and later earned a law degree at the University of Oregon in 2001.

"The Adelmans were an integral part of and positive contributors to our organization and this community from 1983 to 1994," the Blazers said in a statement. "Rick also helped establish the Trail Blazers team as a player during our first three years as a franchise. We join with others around the NBA in keeping the Adelmans in our thoughts and prayers."

"The Rockets organization is deeply saddened to hear of the passing of former assistant coach R.J. Adelman," the statement read. "Our thoughts and prayers are with Rick, Mary Kay, and the entire Adelman family during this very difficult time."

The Timberwolves released a statement, saying: "Our deepest thoughts and condolences are with the family and friends of R.J. Adelman."
