Brooklyn Nets point guard Jeremy Lin, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in the team's opening game of the season, has exercised his $12.5 million option to remain with the team next season, league sources tell ESPN.

Rashad Vaughn, who had been with the Nets for less than a week, is again on the move, as he was traded to New Orleans in exchange for Dante Cunningham.

The move had been expected once Lin tore the patella tendon in his right knee, but it is unusual for players to make decisions on options this early in the NBA calendar.

With Lin officially on board, the Nets are slated to have only about $15 million in cap space this summer -- well short of the amount needed to add a maximum-salaried player. That does not include potential new deals for outgoing free agents Nik Stauskas, Joe Harris, Quincy Acy and Jahlil Okafor.

The Nets view Harris as a potential core player going forward. Brooklyn was not expected to chase star agents this summer regardless.

Lin has played just 34 games in two seasons since the Nets signed him to a three-year, $36 million contract in the summer of 2016. He dealt with hamstring issues last season, but had recovered fully before going down in the first game of this season.
