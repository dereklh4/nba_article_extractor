Fans erupt after Durant, Curry and Green cannot be stopped (0:30)

OAKLAND, Calif. -- For a half, the defending champs looked like their old dazzling selves.

That was enough to beat Dallas. The Warriors are looking for much more from themselves.

Stephen Curry had 20 points, eight assists and seven rebounds, and Golden State bounced back from a tough stretch to top the Mavericks 121-103 on Thursday night.

Kevin Durant added 24 points, nine rebounds, four assists and two blocked shots while Draymond Green put up another impressive line: 12 points, 10 rebounds, six assists, two blocks and two steals.

Dallas star Dirk Nowitzki had 16 points, 11 rebounds, season-high five steals and two blocks, while rookie Dennis Smith Jr. scored 22 points.

Curry's pretty three-point play with 1:28 left in the third put the Warriors up 88-83, and once Golden State got going in transition the Mavericks couldn't keep up in what became a dunk fest. The Warriors began the fourth on a 14-5 tear.

"They strung together a couple of stops, got some easy fast-break points," Smith said. "They took the momentum and kept it from that point on."

Despite another slow start, Golden State eventually found its groove and delivered all the big plays when it mattered.

"We fought through that first half, that malaise, whatever you want to call it and ultimately got it going," coach Steve Kerr said.

The Warriors had dropped three of four, including their worst defeat at home in Tuesday's 125-105 loss to the Thunder.

Klay Thompson added 18 points, five rebounds and four assists on his 28th birthday.

Durant dunked in transition on back-to-back possessions late in the second quarter, one off a steal he made, and Andre Iguodala also had a slam as the Warriors sent the game to halftime tied at 60.

David West contributed 10 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in nearly 17 minutes for Golden State, which earned a 10th straight victory in the series.

"We just had to provide some stability," West said. "That's what we've been talking about with the second unit."

Green was fined $50,000 by the NBA for directing inappropriate and offensive language toward an official during the Oklahoma City loss.

Green was ejected with 8:13 remaining after a second technical for arguing with the officials, specifically female referee Lauren Holtkamp. The NBA said the specific incident for which he was penalized occurred in the second quarter.

On Thursday night, Green got hit with his 14th technical of the season -- two away from an automatic suspension -- in the second quarter for arguing after a delay of game warning.

"I have no idea what will happen," Kerr said. "We know our whole team has been too emotional, too demonstrative. We're going to be under the microscope, we've got to be ready for that."

Green will wear clear braces for a couple of weeks after his front right tooth was knocked back in a collision during Tuesday's loss.

Green said dentists will monitor his tooth.

"It hasn't died. Hopefully it stays alive," he said.
