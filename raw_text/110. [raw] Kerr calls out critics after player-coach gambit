Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr took it easy on Monday night by letting his players handle some of his coaching duties, but he was far less laid-back when asked about his decision Tuesday.

"I've been quickly reminded today of what an insane world we live in, and how everything now is just a story and constantly judged and picked apart," Kerr told 95.7 The Game in San Francisco.

Kerr said that letting his players coach during timeouts in Monday's 129-83 win over the Phoenix Suns was not that big a deal, but said "it's the world we live in so everyone is going to debate it, and whether it's a controversy or not it has to become one, I guess."

Steve Kerr took a breather from coaching in the Warriors' game Monday night against the Suns, handing off his clipboard to Andre Iguodala in the first quarter. David West and Draymond Green also took their turns at the helm.

At various points in Monday's game, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green and David West had control in the huddle. Some criticized Kerr's move as disrespectful. "We have a veteran team. You turn over the timeout huddles to the players so that they can discuss strategy on their own," Kerr said. "I don't think its earth-shattering news."

Despite some apparent backlash, Kerr said he might do it again.

"I don't think it's something we would do often, but I think it's a good exercise," the coach said. "It's a nine-month season. ... This is every single day for seven, eight, nine months depending on how your team does. And so everything gets pretty monotonous. I think you've got to do your best in the NBA to keep things light and loose and occasionally throw the team a curveball. So I can see doing it again one time, a couple times. We'll see."

While Kerr has received some blowback for his decision, some coaches around the league have had a sense of humor about it.

"I noticed their plays were a little better out of timeout tonight," Suns coach Jay Triano jokingly told ESPN's Chris Haynes on Monday night after being on the opposing sideline. "Nah, I didn't have a problem with what Steve did."

Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue also joked about the situation, but said it won't be a strategy he employs.

"I wouldn't do that," Lue said Tuesday before his star, LeBron James, scored 37 points in a victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. "They already said LeBron's coaching the team anyway. If I give him the clipboard, they're really going to say it."
