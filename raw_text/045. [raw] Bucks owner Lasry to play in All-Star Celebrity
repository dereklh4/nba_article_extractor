Four years after buying the Milwaukee Bucks, Marc Lasry has reason to celebrate: His team is steadily trending up, led by one of the NBA's biggest new stars in Giannis Antetokounmpo.

The Bucks are also worth nearly twice the $550 million he and fellow New York investment firm executive Wes Edens paid for the team, according to Forbes.com's projections.

Next Friday, Lasry will need gym shorts and sneakers instead of cufflinks and loafers. He is among 24 players who have committed to showing off their hops in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in Los Angeles, the league said Wednesday.

Lasry will be playing on Team Lakers, coached by ESPN's Rachel Nichols. Tracy McGrady and actor Michael B. Jordan will be on her bench as assistants. McGrady, a Naismith Hall of Famer and ESPN analyst, will also play and be among several former NBA stars to help push the action.

Here are the full rosters and staffs for the game, which will open All-Star Weekend at Staples Center on Feb. 16 at 7 p.m. ET:
