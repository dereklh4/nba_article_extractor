The Houston Rockets have signed guard/forward Joe Johnson for the remainder of the season, the team announced Wednesday.

The Sacramento Kings had placed him on waivers, which he cleared on Monday.

The Kings acquired the guard from the Utah Jazz as part of a three-team deal prior to the NBA trade deadline on Thursday.

The 36-year-old Johnson had played a minor role off the bench for the Jazz this season, averaging 7.3 points and 3.3 rebounds.

Johnson was the 10th overall pick by the Boston Celtics in the 2001 NBA draft.
