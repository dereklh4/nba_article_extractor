CLEVELAND -- On the eve of Thursday's NBA trade deadline, Cavaliers guard Isaiah Thomas said he wants to remain a member of the three-time defending Eastern Conference champions.

"I don't [want to be traded]," Thomas said following Cleveland's 140-138 overtime win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday. "I'm tired of being traded. That's not a good thing, but I just want to be where I'm wanted. I like it here. It hasn't been as planned, but I definitely want to be here. We definitely have a real chance to win an NBA championship, and I want to be a part of that."

Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said Isaiah Thomas' belief that the team makes poor in-game adjustments is "not true." LeBron James had a huge block and the winning buzzer-beater as the Cavs topped the Timberwolves for a much-needed victory. Cavs' Osman to get more time after solid game After a solid performance in Wednesday's win, rookie swingman Cedi Osman will likely see a boost in his playing time, according to Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue.

The Cavs acquired Thomas in August through a trade that sent Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics. He previously was traded from the Sacramento Kings to the Phoenix Suns in July 2014 and from the Suns to the Celtics in February 2015.

Thomas had 13 points on 4-for-8 shooting, seven assists and three rebounds against the Wolves. It was the first time in his past eight games played that he shot 50 percent or better from the field, but he still had a net rating of minus-17.1, according to NBA.com/Stats.

Wednesday's contest was Thomas' 15th game played with the Cavs after sitting out 7 months because of a torn labrum in his right hip.

The Cavs' trade with Boston also netted Cleveland the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 first-round pick, which is expected to be a midtier lottery selection. The Cavs are actively shopping their own first-round pick, multiple sources told ESPN, ahead of Thursday's 3 p.m. ET deadline.

Thomas has struggled to find a rhythm with the Cavs thus far, while remaining a vocal member of the team.

Cavs coach Tyronn Lue spoke about Thomas before the game with the Wolves.

"Just taking some time to get ourselves jelling as far as offensively," Lue said, "with IT being out for so long, and then having to come back and, you know, having to play well, the pressure to play well, when he's really not 100 percent yet as far as getting his legs and conditioning-wise.

"I didn't think it would be like this, but it is something that we got to continue to keep fighting, try to dig ourselves out of this hole."
