PHOENIX -- The San Antonio Spurs opened their long, annual "rodeo road trip" with one of the biggest routs in the team's history.

LaMarcus Aldridge scored 23 points in 28 minutes and the San Antonio Spurs demolished Phoenix 129-81 on Wednesday night.

The 48-point blowout matched the most one-sided loss in Suns history -- set against Portland in this season's opener -- and was the third-largest margin of victory for San Antonio.

Only a 51-point Spurs win at Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 2015, and a 49-point blowout of Vancouver on Nov. 5, 1995 were bigger.

"We made shots," San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. "You make shots, things get easy."

Patty Mills added 18 points and Danny Green 17 for the Spurs. Dejounte Murray scored 14 before leaving with a sprained ankle in the second quarter.

Alex Len scored 14 for the Suns, who shot 34 percent from the field and were 3-of-32 on 3-pointers.

"I think it was an embarrassment for all of us out here tonight," veteran Jared Dudley said. "I think the fans definitely earned an apology for the display. It's definitely unexcusable."

But Popovich thought the Suns did have some mitigating factors.

"Suns' didn't have all their bodies," he said. "You got to have your bodies at this level or it is tough. To have the guys that they have out really hurts."

Phoenix was without leading scorer Devin Booker for the second game in a row due to a hip pointer. Center Tyson Chandler missed the game with a sore neck and Tyler Ulis left with back spasms in the first half.

"We are, I think, obviously undermanned and they just walked all over us," Phoenix interim coach Jay Triano said. "They're a veteran team, they play well and we had no answer."

The Spurs never trailed against a Suns team that has lost four straight and nine of 10. Phoenix's 38 losses are the most in the NBA.

San Antonio dominated from the opening tip and led 69-31 at the half. The 38-point margin was the largest halftime lead for the Spurs against a team in their history. Phoenix never got any closer than 36 points in the second half and trailed by as many as 53 in the fourth quarter.

The Suns averted a 50-point loss with Danuel House's dunk on a fastbreak lob pass with six seconds to play.

"Guys made shots, the ball moved and guys competed on defense," Aldridge said, "so hopefully it will carry over."

The level of competition will go up in a hurry. The Spurs play at Golden State Saturday night.
