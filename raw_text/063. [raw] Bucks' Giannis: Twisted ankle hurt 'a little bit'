NEW YORK -- Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo twisted his right ankle in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 109-94 win over the Brooklyn Nets and did not return. Antetokounmpo did not seem concerned that the injury would keep out of action moving forward.

"At first you feel the pain and then you're like, 'How bad is it?" Antetokounmpo said after the game. "Is it going to be bad? I've twisted it twice in the last five games. But I just got to play through it. We've got the great medical staff that are going to take care of him and Delly. And hopefully I can be ready to go Tuesday vs. the Knicks."

The play occurred with 7:34 left in regulation when Antetokounmpo got tangled up with Nets swingman DeMarre Carroll. Antetokounmpo stayed on the floor for a few moments in pain before gingerly making his way to the bench under his own power. It is the second time in three games Antetokounmpo has suffered an ankle injury. He twisted his left ankle in Thursday's loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite walking around after the game with a slight limp, Antetokounmpo said he could have come back into the game if needed.

"I knew if the game was close I'd definitely be back in," he said "It was hurting a little bit, but if my team needed me to play I would probably just fight through it and play."

Bucks guard Matthew Dellavedova also suffered a sprained right ankle in the fourth quarter. Bucks interim head coach Joe Prunty said both would be re-evaluated on Monday. The Bucks' next game is at Madison Square Garden against the Knicks on Tuesday night.
