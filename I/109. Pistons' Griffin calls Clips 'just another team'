<Blake Griffin/> shares his biggest impressions on being a Piston and how they go the extra mile, and how incredible the fan base is. (0:26)

Detroit Pistons forward <Blake Griffin/> downplayed any extra motivation in his first game facing the LA Clippers, telling ESPN just hours before tipoff Friday night that "they're just another team we're trying to beat."

"I spent a lot of time with some of those guys in that locker room," <Griffin/> said ahead of the 7 p.m. ET tipoff in Auburn Hills, Michigan. "Shared some memories, some good, some bad. At the end of the day, we're worried about our playoff position, we're worried about keeping this ship moving forward."

<Griffin/> headlined the blockbuster trade late last month that sent him, <Brice Johnson/> and <Willie Reed/> to Detroit for <Tobias Harris/>, <Avery Bradley/>, <Boban Marjanovic/>, a first-round and a second-round draft pick.

Can <Blake Griffin/> change the course of a franchise? From Lob City to Motor City, <Blake Griffin/> is facing a familiar challenge in his new NBA home. The Detroit Pistons have added <Jameer Nelson/> and <James Ennis/> in trades with the Bulls and Grizzlies.

"It's always tense when you face somebody that's played for your team," Clippers coach <Doc Rivers/> said. "I was a player; I know how that feels. You want to beat them; if you left on good terms or bad terms, it really doesn't matter. And the guys that played with you want to beat him. Sometime it lends to a competitive game, sometime it leads to a locker room hostage situation. You never know."

He admitted the deal surprised him at the time but that feeling has waned since.

"Anytime you're caught off-guard, I don't know that you're necessarily prepared for it," <Griffin/> told ESPN. "Today, I feel much more settled in. I know my routine, I know where I'm going in a few spots. I feel much more at home now than I did the first day."

Asked if he's spoken to <Rivers/> since the deal went down, <Griffin/> said "no" without elaborating.

As for his new coach, <Stan Van Gundy/>, <Griffin/> was highly complimentary.

"He's a very, very smart coach," <Griffin/> said. "X's and O's-wise, he gets basketball [like] few do. Having him on my side and our side is a huge advantage to us. Right now it's just learning, trying to feel each other out. They've put in new stuff, it's a continual process and it's going to take some time, but it's gone pretty smooth."

<Griffin/> was equally complimentary of the Pistons organization as a whole.

"It's a first-class organization, they're run very, very well," he said. "They take care of their players, they do the little things, they go the extra mile. As far as the city, the fans are unbelievable. It's a great sports town. You see that a little bit, but you can just tell by how the fans have supported us and the things the fans say just walking around town and everything that you experience."
