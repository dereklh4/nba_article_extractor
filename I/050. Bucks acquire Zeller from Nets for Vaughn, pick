The Milwaukee Bucks have acquired center <Tyler Zeller/> from the Brooklyn Nets for former first-round draft pick <Rashad Vaughn/> and a 2018 second-round pick.

Trade grades: Did Bucks or Nets win the <Zeller/> deal? Will <Tyler Zeller/> help the Bucks' playoff chances this season, and how did the Nets do in the deal? <Kevin Pelton/> grades the trade. <Lowe/>: What to expect and what could surprise at the NBA trade deadline Is there a deal out there to help the Cavs? Are the Warriors going to make a move? And what will happen with <DeAndre Jordan/> and <Marcus Smart/>? Here's the latest.

<Zeller/> gives the Bucks a solid backup center for the playoff push. The deal gives the Nets a chance to further replenish their future pool of draft picks.

The Bucks will send the 2018 second-round pick to the Nets should it fall between 31 and 47 in the draft. Otherwise, Phoenix will receive the pick as part of the <Eric Bledsoe/> trade. If the Bucks pick doesn't convey in 2018, Milwaukee will send its unprotected second-round pick in 2020 to Brooklyn, league sources said.

The Nets have $3.5 million in salary-cap space available, as well as a $6 million disabled player exception from the season-ending <Jeremy Lin/> injury.

<Zeller/>, 28, will compete for minutes behind starting Bucks center <John Henson/>. <Zeller/> has averaged 7 points and 4.6 rebounds in 2017-18. He has played with Cleveland and Boston in his six NBA seasons.

<Vaughn/>, 21, was the 17th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft, but has been unable so far to get traction in the league. He has averaged 3.1 points in two-plus seasons.
