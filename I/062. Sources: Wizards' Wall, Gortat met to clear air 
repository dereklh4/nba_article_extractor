<Tim Legler/> explains why it was good for <John Wall/> and <Marcin Gortat/> to meet privately to clear the air after <Gortat/> sent a tweet that was seemingly a jab at <Wall/>. (1:11)

Washington Wizards teammates <John Wall/> and <Marcin Gortat/> met privately last week to confront each other about where they stood after <Gortat/>'s tweet two weeks ago that many interpreted as a passive-aggressive slight directed at the All-Star guard, league sources told ESPN.

It was the first time the two spoke in person regarding the tweet, according to league sources.

Both Wizards players requested the sit-down, sources say.

The meeting, which didn't last long, facilitated the airing of grievances, but sources say there is still more work to be done to fully repair that relationship.

Those close to the franchise suggest these are natural altercations from the rigors of such an emotional season.

After a 122-119 win over the red-hot Toronto Raptors on Feb. 1, the team's third-consecutive victory with <Wall/> sidelined as he recovers from knee surgery, <Gortat/> tweeted:

Soon after, <Wall/>, sources say, reached out to <Gortat/> via a text message and essentially stated that if there's a problem, to direct it to him instead of using social media to spew backhanded insults, sources with knowledge of the conversation told ESPN.

<Gortat/> has explained that his tweet was never intended as a jab at <Wall/>, and he reiterated that he was genuinely praising the team for a big win.

When ESPN's <Michael Smith/> asked <Wall/> about <Gortat/>'s tweet on SportsCenter, the point guard replied, "It was more just shock to hear it from him, understanding he gets the most assists from me and the most spoon-fed baskets ever."

The organization may look into enforcing a policy that enables the team to fine players for tweets that could be perceived as being detrimental to the team, sources say.

<Wall/> is expected to return in mid-March.
