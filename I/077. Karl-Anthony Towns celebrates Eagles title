<Stephen A. Smith/> reflects on the great Philadelphia sports memories, topped off by the Eagles' Super Bowl victory. (1:52)

MINNEAPOLIS -- Timberwolves All-Star big man <Karl-Anthony Towns/> is still beaming two days after watching his Philadelphia Eagles win the Super Bowl.

"I'm living the hype," <Towns/> said after Tuesday's practice, still proudly wearing his Eagles jersey. "I'm living the wave right now. It's a good time to be an Eagles fan."

<Towns/>, like many Timberwolves players and personnel, was in attendance on Sunday night at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis to watch the Eagles pull off the upset win.

"It was great," <Towns/> said. "It was great to be in Minneapolis, being able to watch the Eagles here at home. It was an amazing experience. The game was truly amazing. I don't think anyone would disagree. If you were a Vikings fan, if you were a Seahawks fan, whatever you are. If you're a football fan that game was absolutely amazing."

<Towns/> joked that Timberwolves coach <Tom Thibodeau/>, a die-hard New England Patriots fan and friend of coach <Bill Belichick/>, wasn't returning his calls after the game ended.

"I couldn't flaunt it; he didn't answer my calls," <Towns/> said. "He's not answering any of my phone calls, so I finally got to see him today for the first time. I really didn't want to rub it in too much. We got a game against the [Cavs] -- I think we got a little bigger fish to fry right now."

<Thibodeau/>, who was also in attendance on Sunday night, was complimentary of <Towns/>' demeanor to this point.

"He's actually handled it well," <Thibodeau/> said. "So far."

<Towns/> said he grew up with Eagles safety <Malcolm Jenkins/> -- both were raised in central New Jersey -- and was able to see the victory up close given that he worked as a credentialed photographer at the game for The Players' Tribune.

"Sounds like something he would do," <Thibodeau/> said, drawing chuckles from the assembled media. "He's got a lot of different interests, so I guess it's his way of having fun. That's who he is."

Timberwolves veteran <Jamal Crawford/> said <Towns/> hasn't been keeping quiet around his teammates.

"<Karl/> talks a bunch of s--- regardless," <Crawford/> said. "He's always talking. But yeah, he's talking a little bit more [after the win]."
