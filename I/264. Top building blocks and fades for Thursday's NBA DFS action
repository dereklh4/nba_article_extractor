Which players should you build around and which players should you fade in DFS as we tip off tonight's NBA action? Our experts have the answers.

Today's panel includes ESPN Fantasy's <Andr Snellings/> and <Kyle Soppe/>. as well as DFS expert <Renee Miller/>.

After watching a fantasy feast from the Cavaliers and Timberwolves on Wednesday, <Andr Snellings/> explains why we all should have read the tea leaves and stacked both sides.

<George/> has been playing great ball for a while now and seemed to pick it up further around the time that he was initially snubbed and then eventually granted All-Star status. During his last 10 games, he has averaged 28.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.6 3-pointers, 2.7 assists and 2.3 steals. On Thursday, <Russell Westbrook/> is questionable with a sprained ankle, and if he sits, <George/> would have to pick it up even more against his hometown Los Angeles Lakers. They've allowed the third-most fantasy points to opposing small forwards this season.

Targeting the Warriors seems counterintuitive to everything we've learned over the past three seasons, but until they get a chance to rest during the All-Star break, it's a very viable strategy. The Dubs have coughed up 118.3 points per game over their past four games, and we aren't talking about offensively potent opponents (Utah Jazz, Sacramento Kings, Denver Nuggets and Thunder). <Smith Jr/>. leads the Mavs in usage rate this season, and with <Harrison Barnes/> battling an ankle injury, he should have plenty of opportunities to smash value in this spot. The rookie has handed out at least five dimes in 10 straight, and his athleticism is intriguing in a game that figures to be played at a much faster pace than a normal Mavs game.

<O'Quinn/> has long been a DFS favorite when provided the opportunity to produce, going back to his Orlando Magic days. The Knicks haven't generally provided him that stable opportunity, but he is literally the only big man standing in the New York frontcourt tonight. While <Michael Beasley/>'s salary is over $6,000 on both sites, <O'Quinn/>'s is closer to $4,000. He's a steal at that price if he gets over 25 minutes, and with <Enes Kanter/> out, Willie <Hernangomez/> gone and <Kristaps Porzingis/> done for the season, it could easily be 35 minutes for <O'Quinn/> tonight. The matchup isn't ideal, but everything else is. Look for a 30-plus fantasy point effort from <O'Quinn/> tonight, and consider <Tim Hardaway Jr/>. if you're looking for a lesser-used Knicks player with upside tonight.

There are no obvious fade candidates to my eye on Thursday, as there are no dominant defenses going. However, there are some games that project to be blowouts, including the Warriors hosting the Mavericks. <Durant/> is on the injury report as questionable with a hand contusion, so it's possible that he sits. Even if he does play, though, this has the feel of a potential doldrums game against what should be an overmatched opponent in the week before the All-Star break, and maybe one that <Durant/> may not live up to his max DFS salary.

I expect the Atlanta matchup to draw people in, but I'm not flirting with <Fournier/> on this slate. First of all, his price tag is reflective of the plus matchup (his DraftKings price is up 15.8 percent from Tuesday), so it's not as if you are pulling something over on anyone. The increase in price leaves very little room for upside, especially when you consider that he hasn't taken more than 13 shots in five straight games and that there is significant downside given how much he is relying on the 3-pointer (48.3 percent of his shots over that stretch). We've yet to see <Fournier/> average more than 6.1 rebounds-plus-assists per game for a season in his career, so he is not going to bail you out elsewhere should the jumper not be falling. That makes him more risk than I am willing to take tonight.

<Ingram/> has been fantastic lately, finding himself up among the building blocks in some recent games. However, facing off with the Thunder and <George/> hasn't been a formula for success. In three games with Oklahoma City, <Ingram/> has played 30 MPG, but averaged just 21.6 DraftKings points. The loss of <Andre Roberson/> has eased things a little bit, but the Thunder remain a top-4 team in defensive efficiency, play at a significantly slower pace than the Lakers and are road favorites tonight. I'm paying not much more for <George/> at SF tonight.
