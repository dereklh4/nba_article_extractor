The Phoenix Suns plan to suspend forward <Marquese Chriss/> for a game stemming from a verbal confrontation with an assistant coach, league sources told ESPN.

General manager <Ryan McDonough/> confirmed to Arizona Sports 98.7 FM that <Chriss/> likely will not play when the Suns host the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday.

"He violated a team rule," <McDonough/> said. "He probably won't be with us for the game tomorrow. He's a good kid who had a bad moment. We look forward to seeing him on Monday morning so we can turn the page and move on."

The incident occurred after Friday night's 129-97 loss to the Utah Jazz, according to sources.

An argument broke out over a postgame routine <Chriss/> is required to do, sources said.

The second-year forward played 14 minutes in the game and scored three points.

<Chriss/>, 20, was drafted eighth overall in 2016 by the Sacramento Kings and traded to Phoenix on draft night for <Bogdan Bogdanovic/>, <Skal Labissiere/>, <Georgios Papagiannis/> and a 2020 second-round pick.

<Chriss/> is averaging 7.0 points per game this season.
