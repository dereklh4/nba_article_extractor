<Joe Johnson/> has committed to signing with the Houston Rockets after his contract buyout from the Sacramento Kings was completed Saturday, league sources told ESPN.

<Johnson/>, 36, will clear waivers on Monday afternoon and be eligible to sign immediately thereafter.

The Kings acquired the guard from the Utah Jazz as part of a three-team deal prior to the NBA trade deadline on Thursday.

<Johnson/> is the second player to commit to signing with the Rockets out of the buyout market. Forward <Brandan Wright/>, who officially was waived the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday, will sign with the Rockets upon clearing waivers, league sources told ESPN's <Chris Haynes/>.

And, along with <Gerald Green/>, the Rockets will now have acquired three veteran contributors without surrendering any assets. <Green/>, who is averaging 13.9 points per game for the Rockets, was unemployed for more than two months this season.

The Rockets on Friday re-signed guard <Bobby Brown/> for the rest of the season but will now waive him to clear a roster spot for <Johnson/>, league sources told ESPN.

<Johnson/> had played a minor role off the bench for the Jazz this season, averaging 7.3 points and 3.3 rebounds. According to ESPN Stats & Information, he is 39 3-pointers shy of becoming the ninth player in NBA history with 2,000.

He has earned $214 million in his career -- fourth most among active players, behind <Dirk Nowitzki/>, <LeBron James/> and <Carmelo Anthony/>.
