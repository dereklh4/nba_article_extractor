Does your fantasy basketball team have a few glaring issues? Is it weak in certain categories? Are you really good in some areas but lacking in others?

Here are some widely available players around the NBA who can help upgrade your roster in the categories you need.

Note: Every player listed is on less than 50 percent of rosters in ESPN leagues.

<Michael Beasley/>, SF/PF, New York Knicks (48.1 percent) -- Still available in more than half of ESPN leagues, <Beasley/> has the natural scoring ability to average close to 20.0 PPG now that <Kristaps Porzingis/> (knee) is lost for the season. It comes down to minutes for the veteran forward, and there's a good chance he gets quite a bit more for the final months of the regular season.

<Josh Jackson/>, SG/SF, Phoenix Suns (39.0 percent) -- <Jackson/> continues to thrive with additional playing time. He has reached 20 points four times during his past six games and is also a strong rebounder and emerging force in terms of steals and blocks. The only question is why he's still available in 61.0 percent of ESPN leagues. Which players gained and lost fantasy value due to NBA trade deadline swaps? We break down every notable deal throughout the day right here. Yes, from a math standpoint, 1+1+1 makes 3. But <John Cregan/> explains that from a fantasy perspective, being one of the few 1+1+1 players in the NBA involves much more than just making 3s.

<Al-Farouq Aminu/>, SF/PF, Portland Trail Blazers (20.5 percent) -- <Aminu/> does more than just rebound -- he also shoots the 3-pointer and contributes as a scorer and shot-blocker -- but his rebounding prowess is what makes him most useful. He has pulled down 9.4 RPG during his past five games, including a 14-rebound effort against the Pistons on Monday.

<Tyson Chandler/>, C, Phoenix Suns (17.6 percent) -- <Chandler/> will be rested on a regular basis in Phoenix, but he's a good bet to get double-digit rebounds whenever he is in the lineup. The veteran center has done just that in each of his past two games and in three of his past five.

<Rajon Rondo/>, PG, New Orleans Pelicans (47.0 percent) -- <Rondo/>'s offensive production hasn't increased since <DeMarcus Cousins/> was lost for the season with an Achilles injury, but he can still distribute with the best of them. He is averaging 7.2 APG this season and has games with 13 and 8 assists in the past week.

<Tim Frazier/>, PG/SG, Washington Wizards (1.5 percent) -- <Frazier/>'s value lasts only as long as <John Wall/> is sidelined, but that is expected to be for another 5-7 weeks or so. <Frazier/> doesn't score much, but he can provide assists and steals in a pinch; he has averaged 4.9 APG and 1.1 SPG during his past eight games.

<Tomas Satoransky/>, PG/SF, Washington Wizards (10.1 percent) -- Getting more minutes since <Wall/> went down, <Satoransky/> has quietly come up with two steals in each of the Wizards' past five games while also contributing 5.0 APG during that span.

<Wesley Johnson/>, SF, LA Clippers (2.9 percent) -- <Johnson/>'s minutes are down since the <Blake Griffin/> trade that brought in <Avery Bradley/> and <Tobias Harris/>, but he remains a force defensively. The former lottery pick has averaged 1.5 SPG this season and 2.2 SPG during his past five games.

<Jakob Poeltl/>, PF/C, Toronto Raptors (3.0 percent) -- I've mentioned the second-year big man in the past, and he remains an under-the-radar shot-blocking option, with two blocks in four of his past five games. He also provides rebounding and efficient scoring.

<Bismack Biyombo/>, C, Orlando Magic (16.1 percent) -- <Nikola Vucevic/> is set to return any game now, which will undoubtedly have many fantasy managers sending <Biyombo/> back to the waiver wire. That means that if you're streaming for blocks in the weeks ahead, there's a good chance you'll be able to add the veteran shot-blocker and rebounder.

<JR Smith/>, SG/SF, Cleveland Cavaliers (5.0 percent) -- <Smith/> is a bit risky considering all the player movement on the Cavs, with <Isaiah Thomas/>, <Channing Frye/>, <Dwyane Wade/>, <Derrick Rose/> and <Iman Shumpert/> leaving and <Rodney Hood/>, <George Hill/>, <Larry Nance Jr/>. and <Jordan Clarkson/> joining the team. But <Smith/> also has sunk 13 3-pointers during his past three games. Maybe give it a game or two with the new rotation to see if Smith is still getting into a suitable role before you pick him up.

<Marcus Morris/>, PF, Boston Celtics (14.6 percent) -- <Morris/> has connected on at least two 3-pointers in four of his past five games and also is a force as a scorer and rebounder. The only thing to watch is whether <Greg Monroe/> significantly reduces his minutes once <Monroe/> enters the rotation.
